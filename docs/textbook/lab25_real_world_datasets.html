                <h4>From Theory to Practice</h4>
                <p>While previous labs have focused on the theoretical foundations and algorithmic approaches of computational genetic genealogy, this lab addresses the "reality gap"â€”the set of challenges that emerge when applying these methods to real-world data:</p>
                
                <h5>Key Real-World Challenges</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Quality and Completeness:</strong> Missing, sparse, or variable-quality genetic data</li>
                    <li><strong>Population Diversity:</strong> Different genetic patterns across diverse human populations</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing Platform Differences:</strong> Variations in SNP coverage, phasing quality, and analysis methods</li>

            <h3>Data Quality and Completeness</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Handling Imperfect Data</h4>
                <p>Real-world genetic genealogy datasets rarely have the completeness and quality assumed by theoretical models. Bonsai v3 implements several strategies to handle these imperfections:</p>

                <h5>Partial Data Strategies</h5>
                <p>Bonsai implements several approaches for working with partial or incomplete data:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Graceful Degradation:</strong> Algorithms that continue to function with reduced accuracy as data quality decreases</li>
                    <li><strong>Confidence Calibration:</strong> Adjusting confidence scores based on data completeness</li>
                    <li><strong>Imputation Techniques:</strong> Filling in missing data using population references where appropriate</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Weighting:</strong> Giving more weight to high-quality data regions in relationship inference</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Population-Specific Patterns</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Adapting to Human Genetic Diversity</h4>
                <p>Human populations have different genetic histories and characteristics that affect genetic genealogy analysis. Bonsai v3 accounts for these population-specific patterns:</p>
                
                <h5>Key Population Considerations</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Recombination Rate Variation:</strong> Different populations show different patterns of genetic recombination</li>
                    <li><strong>Runs of Homozygosity (ROH):</strong> Endogamous populations have more and longer ROH regions</li>
                    <li><strong>Demographic History:</strong> Population bottlenecks and expansions affect genetic diversity</li>
                    <li><strong>Admixture Patterns:</strong> Mixed ancestry creates complex IBD patterns</li>
                    <li><strong>Reference Bias:</strong> Most genetic references are skewed toward European populations</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="note-box">
                    <h5>Population-Aware Calibration</h5>
                    <p>Bonsai v3 includes population-specific calibration for several key parameters:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Recombination Maps:</strong> Population-specific genetic maps for more accurate genetic distance calculation</li>
                        <li><strong>IBD Detection Thresholds:</strong> Adjusted thresholds for populations with different background IBD patterns</li>
                        <li><strong>Relationship Likelihood Models:</strong> Population-specific parameters for relationship inference</li>
                        <li><strong>Endogamy Correction:</strong> Population-specific adjustment factors for endogamous groups</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <h5>Implementation Approaches</h5>
                <p>Several implementation strategies enable effective handling of population diversity:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Population Inference:</strong> Automatically detecting population background from genetic data</li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptive Parameters:</strong> Adjusting algorithm parameters based on detected population</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Reference Models:</strong> Using multiple population references for improved accuracy</li>
                    <li><strong>Admixture-Aware Analysis:</strong> Handling segments from different ancestral populations appropriately</li>

            <h3>Testing Platform Differences</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Integrating Data from Multiple Sources</h4>
                <p>Real-world genetic genealogy often involves integrating data from multiple testing platforms, each with different characteristics. Bonsai v3 addresses these platform differences:</p>
                
                <h5>Major Testing Platform Variations</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SNP Coverage:</strong> Different tests analyze different subsets of SNPs</li>
                    <li><strong>Chip Versions:</strong> Testing companies frequently update their genotyping arrays</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis Algorithms:</strong> Different companies use different algorithms for IBD detection</li>
                    <li><strong>Reporting Formats:</strong> Data formats and segment reporting criteria vary</li>
                    <li><strong>Reference Populations:</strong> Different platforms use different reference populations</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>Cross-Platform Integration Approaches</h5>
                <p>Bonsai implements several strategies for effective cross-platform integration:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Common SNP Analysis:</strong> Focusing analysis on SNPs common to all platforms</li>
                    <li><strong>Platform-Specific Calibration:</strong> Adjusting expectations based on known platform characteristics</li>
                    <li><strong>Format Normalization:</strong> Converting data from different sources to a consistent internal format</li>
                    <li><strong>Confidence Adjustment:</strong> Modifying confidence scores based on platform compatibility</li>
                </ol>
                
                <div class="note-box">
                    <h5>Platform Compatibility Matrix</h5>
                    <p>Bonsai maintains a compatibility matrix for common testing platforms, informing its cross-platform integration strategies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>High Compatibility:</strong> Platforms with similar SNP sets and analysis methods</li>
                        <li><strong>Moderate Compatibility:</strong> Platforms with partial SNP overlap but different analysis methods</li>
                        <li><strong>Low Compatibility:</strong> Platforms with minimal SNP overlap or fundamentally different approaches</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This matrix helps Bonsai adjust its algorithms and confidence reporting when working with mixed-platform data.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion and Next Steps</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <p>Working with real-world genetic genealogy datasets presents numerous challenges that go beyond theoretical models and ideal conditions. Bonsai v3 addresses these challenges through a combination of robust algorithms, adaptive parameters, population-specific calibration, and careful handling of data quality issues.</p>
                
                <p>By understanding and accounting for data quality issues, population-specific patterns, testing platform differences, privacy considerations, and scale challenges, Bonsai creates more reliable and accurate pedigree reconstructions from real-world data.</p>
