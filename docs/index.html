            <h2>Research Overview</h2>
            <p>Our lab explores the intersection of biological and sociocultural anthropology through genetic genealogy, focusing on connections between Africa and its historic diaspora. We employ computational techniques to reconstruct genetic genealogy networks spanning up to nine generations, creating powerful links that connect Africans and members of the historic African diaspora in a continuum of shared family, community, and population history.</p>
            <p>This research examines both the biological and social dimensions of genetic genealogy among persons with recent ancestors from Africa. We investigate family and ethnic identity development among African Americans using genetic genealogy to identify and interact with genetic relatives in Africa, while also studying African perspectives on these genealogical connections with descendants of ancestors displaced during the Transatlantic Slave Trade.</p>

                <p>This course equips students with computational tools to analyze familial lineages. Using Python, Java, and Bash-based genetic analyses, students will explore family structures and genetic genealogy inferences spanning the last seven generations. The course emphasizes practical applications in anthropology, enabling students to assist in the analysis and interpretation of complex genetic genealogy studies. Students will learn to apply these skills in the real-world historical context of mass transatlantic human trafficking from Africa.</p>
