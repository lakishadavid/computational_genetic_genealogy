    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we explored how Bonsai v3 efficiently adds new individuals to existing pedigrees one at a time, rather than rebuilding the entire structure. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connection Point Identification**: Finding individuals in the existing pedigree who share IBD with the new individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relationship Evaluation**: Systematically evaluating different relationship configurations based on IBD sharing and demographic constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Physical Addition**: Implementing the addition of a new individual with a specific relationship to an existing individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Incremental Building**: Using these techniques to build a pedigree incrementally by adding individuals one at a time in an optimal order.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Optimizations**: Implementing optimizations to make the process more efficient, especially for large pedigrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "This incremental approach is critical for performance when working with large datasets and for updating pedigrees as new genetic data becomes available. It allows Bonsai v3 to scale to much larger pedigrees than would be possible with direct optimization of the entire structure."
