# Session 24: Complex Relationship Patterns (relationships.py)

## Session Overview
This session examines how Bonsai v3 handles complex relationship patterns through specialized logic in the `relationships.py` module, addressing the challenges of non-standard and compound genealogical connections.

## Key Topics

### 1. Beyond Standard Relationships
- The diversity of genealogical relationships
- Challenges of complex relationship patterns:
  - Compound relationships (related in multiple ways)
  - Endogamous relationships (marriage between relatives)
  - Unusual generational patterns
  - Cultural and historical variations
- Impact on pedigree reconstruction accuracy

### 2. The `relationships.py` Module Structure
- Design philosophy and implementation approach
- Key components and classes
- Integration with other system modules
- Configuration parameters and customization
- Relationship type taxonomy

### 3. Relationship Representation System
- The relationship tuple format in detail:
  ```python
  # (degree1, removal1, degree2, removal2, half)
  (1, 0, 1, 0, 0)  # Full siblings
  (1, 0, 0, 0, 1)  # Parent-child
  (2, 0, 2, 0, 0)  # First cousins
  ```
- Relationship space coverage
- Implementation of relationship conversion functions
- Canonical representation of relationships

### 4. Compound Relationship Handling
- Detection of compound relationships
- Modeling genetic sharing for multiple connections
- Likelihood computation for compound cases
- Implementation in compound relationship functions
- Example: double first cousins

### 5. Endogamous Relationship Analysis
- Genetic signatures of endogamy
- Adjusting relationship models for endogamous populations
- Background IBD calibration for endogamy
- Implementation in endogamy-aware functions
- Example: cousin marriage effects

### 6. Relationship Distance Computation
- Calculating genealogical distance between individuals
- Shortest path algorithms in relationship graphs
- Handling complex connection patterns
- Implementation in relationship distance functions
- Relationship classification based on distance

### 7. Relationship Comparison and Equivalence
- Determining if relationships are equivalent
- Ranking relationships by closeness
- Comparing alternative relationship hypotheses
- Implementation in relationship comparison functions
- Practical application in decision-making

### 8. Non-Standard Family Structures
- Handling adoption and non-biological relationships
- Same-sex parents and modern family structures
- Cultural variations in family systems
- Implementation in flexible relationship models
- Configuration for different cultural contexts

### 9. Half-Relationship Modeling
- Representation of half-relationships
- Genetic expectations for half-relationships
- Age modeling considerations
- Implementation in half-relationship functions
- Example: half-siblings vs. first cousins

### 10. Relationship Inference Under Uncertainty
- Probabilistic relationship determination
- Confidence scoring for complex relationships
- Alternative relationship hypotheses
- Implementation in relationship inference functions
- Practical guidelines for interpretation

## Practical Components
- Implementing relationship conversion functions
- Modeling compound relationship IBD patterns
- Computing relationship distances in complex pedigrees
- Handling endogamous relationship cases

## Recommended Reading
- Papers on complex relationship detection
- Literature on endogamy in genetic genealogy
- Graph theory for relationship distance calculation
- Cultural studies of family systems
- Statistical methods for relationship classification
