            <h2>Lab 5: Advanced Identity-by-Descent Detection with Hap-IBD</h2>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p><strong>Conceptual Foundations:</strong> This lab explores how different computational approaches can identify the same biological phenomenon—genetic segments shared through common ancestry. Understanding these algorithmic variations provides deeper insight into the reliability and limitations of relationship inference from genetic data.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Algorithmic Diversity in Genetic Analysis</h4>
                <p>The field of computational genetic genealogy employs multiple algorithms to solve the same fundamental problem—identifying IBD segments:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Methodological Pluralism:</strong> Different computational approaches can detect the same biological signal</li>
                    <li><strong>Complementary Strengths:</strong> Each algorithm excels in different contexts or data types</li>
                    <li><strong>Convergent Evidence:</strong> Agreement between different methods increases confidence in detected relationships</li>
                    <li><strong>Illuminating Blind Spots:</strong> Method-specific failures reveal limitations in our analytical frameworks</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you implement Hap-IBD alongside IBIS in this lab, you're applying the scientific principle of methodological triangulation—using multiple independent approaches to verify a finding. This principle is essential in fields like genetic genealogy where ground truth is often unknown.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Positional Burrows-Wheeler Transform: A Revolutionary Approach</h4>
                <p>Hap-IBD introduces a fundamentally different computational technique to IBD detection:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Suffix Arrays and Transformations:</strong> Hap-IBD adapts text-matching algorithms (originally developed for genome assembly and read mapping) to rapidly identify matching haplotype segments</li>
                    <li><strong>Pattern Recognition vs. Probabilistic Models:</strong> While IBIS uses a probabilistic HMM approach, Hap-IBD employs a pattern-matching approach to directly identify identical haplotype stretches</li>
                    <li><strong>Computational Efficiency:</strong> The PBWT approach enables dramatically faster processing (often 10-100x faster) than traditional HMM-based methods</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The algorithm scales nearly linearly with sample size, making it feasible to analyze datasets with hundreds of thousands of individuals</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This shift in algorithmic approach represents a paradigm change in IBD detection. Rather than modeling the probability of IBD states (as in IBIS), Hap-IBD directly identifies matching patterns in the genetic data, similar to how text search engines identify matching strings in documents.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Haplotype-Level vs. Genotype-Level Analysis</h4>
                <p>A fundamental distinction between Hap-IBD and IBIS is their treatment of maternal and paternal chromosomes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Haplotype Resolution:</strong> Hap-IBD works with phased data, explicitly identifying which parental chromosome (maternal or paternal) contains each IBD segment</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Precision:</strong> This haplotype-level resolution provides more detailed information about exactly how individuals are related</li>
                    <li><strong>Evolutionary Insight:</strong> Knowing which specific haplotype carries an IBD segment helps reconstruct the transmission path through a family tree</li>
                    <li><strong>Identification Limitations:</strong> Hap-IBD requires phased data, which introduces a dependency on phasing accuracy</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The haplotype-level resolution provided by Hap-IBD creates a more detailed picture of genetic inheritance, revealing not just that two individuals share DNA, but precisely which parental chromosomes contain the shared segments. This additional layer of information enhances our ability to reconstruct genealogical relationships.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Technical and Algorithmic Foundations</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Computational Cost of Exhaustive Comparison</h4>
                <p>A fundamental challenge in IBD detection is the computational burden of comparing all possible pairs of individuals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quadratic Growth:</strong> The number of pairwise comparisons grows as O(n²) with the number of samples</li>
                    <li><strong>Marker Density:</strong> Each comparison involves examining tens or hundreds of thousands of genetic markers</li>
                    <li><strong>Traditional Approaches:</strong> IBIS and similar methods must compute likelihood ratios at each position for each pair</li>
                    <li><strong>Hap-IBD Innovation:</strong> The PBWT algorithm drastically reduces this computational burden by identifying matching haplotypes without examining all possible pairs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Hap-IBD's computational efficiency isn't just about saving time—it fundamentally changes what's possible in genetic genealogy. Analyses that would take months or be completely infeasible with traditional methods can be completed in hours or days, enabling the analysis of very large datasets for the first time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Parameter Selection and Biological Meaning</h4>
                <p>The parameters used when running Hap-IBD represent important biological assumptions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>min-seed Parameter:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Represents the minimum length of initial matching segments</li>
                            <li>Shorter values increase sensitivity but decrease specificity</li>
                            <li>Biological interpretation: How short of a segment might indicate a real relationship?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>min-extend Parameter:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Controls how far to extend matched segments beyond initial seeds</li>
                            <li>Balances detection of full segment length vs. inclusion of chance matches</li>
                            <li>Biological interpretation: How do we distinguish IBD segment boundaries from random matches?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>min-output Parameter:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sets the minimum reportable segment length</li>
                            <li>Filters out short segments likely to be false positives</li>
                            <li>Biological interpretation: What is the minimum IBD length likely to indicate genealogical relevance?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>These parameters aren't just technical settings but represent biological hypotheses about the nature of genetic sharing between relatives. When you adjust these parameters, you're testing different assumptions about how genetic material flows through family trees across generations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Nature of Algorithmic Agreement and Disagreement</h4>
                <p>When comparing IBD segments detected by different algorithms, several patterns emerge:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High-Confidence Segments:</strong> Long segments (>10 cM) detected by multiple methods are highly likely to represent true IBD</li>
                    <li><strong>Algorithm-Specific Detections:</strong> Segments detected by only one method require careful evaluation</li>
                    <li><strong>Boundary Disagreement:</strong> Different algorithms often agree on segment presence but disagree on exact endpoints</li>
                    <li><strong>Method-Specific Strengths:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>IBIS: Generally more sensitive for shorter segments in unphased data</li>
                            <li>Hap-IBD: More precise determination of segment boundaries and haplotype assignment</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Understanding these patterns of agreement and disagreement helps develop a more nuanced interpretation of IBD results. The comparison across methods reveals not just the segments themselves but their relative reliability and the limitations of each detection approach.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Applications in Genetic Genealogy</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Consensus Building in Relationship Inference</h4>
                <p>Using multiple detection methods creates an opportunity for consensus-based relationship inference:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Confidence Tiers:</strong> Relationships can be categorized by the number of methods that support them</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Characterization:</strong> Systematic differences between methods reveal potential biases in relationship detection</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrated Approaches:</strong> Combined evidence from multiple algorithms can be incorporated into relationship probability calculations</li>
                    <li><strong>Method Selection:</strong> For specific relationship questions, the most appropriate method can be selected based on known strengths</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In practical genetic genealogy applications, this multi-method approach helps distinguish between high-confidence relationships that can inform genealogical conclusions and more tentative connections that require additional evidence before incorporation into family trees.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Reconstructing Complex Family Structures</h4>
                <p>The haplotype-level resolution provided by Hap-IBD offers particular value for complex family structures:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Half-Relationships:</strong> Explicitly identifies which parental haplotype contains shared segments, helping distinguish half-siblings from full siblings</li>
                    <li><strong>Endogamous Communities:</strong> Provides more precise characterization of segment sharing in populations with high background relatedness</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Path Relationships:</strong> Helps disentangle cases where individuals are related through multiple ancestral lines</li>
                    <li><strong>Generation Identification:</strong> The distribution of maternal vs. paternal haplotype sharing provides clues about relationship type</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The additional detail provided by haplotype-specific IBD detection creates new opportunities for resolving complex relationship networks that might appear ambiguous with genotype-level approaches alone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>From Individual Segments to Relationship Networks</h4>
                <p>Multiple IBD detection methods contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of relationship networks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Network Completeness:</strong> Different methods may identify different subsets of relationships, creating a more complete network</li>
                    <li><strong>Edge Weighting:</strong> Agreement between methods can be used to weight the confidence of relationships in network analyses</li>
                    <li><strong>Cluster Identification:</strong> Robust clusters of related individuals emerge more clearly when supported by multiple methods</li>
                    <li><strong>Temporal Depth:</strong> The combination of methods with different strength profiles improves detection across multiple generations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When analyzing community-wide genetic connections—such as in diaspora communities seeking historical connections—this multi-method approach helps build more complete and reliable relationship networks, revealing community structures that might remain partially hidden with any single method.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Anthropological and Historical Context</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Methodological Robustness in Historical Recovery</h4>
                <p>For anthropologists working to recover historical connections disrupted by events like the transatlantic slave trade, methodological robustness is essential:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Evidentiary Standards:</strong> Historical claims based on genetic connections require particularly strong evidence</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-validation:</strong> Multiple computational methods provide a form of cross-validation for detected relationships</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration with Historical Evidence:</strong> Genetic relationships supported by multiple methods provide stronger foundations for integration with historical records</li>
                    <li><strong>Managing Uncertainty:</strong> Method comparison helps characterize uncertainty in relationship detection, enabling appropriate qualification of conclusions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In contexts where genetic evidence may inform historical understanding or reconnect displaced communities, methodological thoroughness is an ethical imperative. Using multiple IBD detection approaches helps ensure that conclusions about historical connections rest on solid methodological foundations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Population-Specific Performance Considerations</h4>
                <p>Different IBD detection methods may perform differently across diverse populations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reference Bias:</strong> Methods developed and tested primarily on European datasets may have different performance characteristics in African or Asian populations</li>
                    <li><strong>Haplotype Diversity:</strong> Populations with higher genetic diversity present different computational challenges for IBD detection</li>
                    <li><strong>Admixture Effects:</strong> Recently admixed populations may show complex patterns that are detected with different efficiencies by different methods</li>
                    <li><strong>Historical Demography:</strong> Population-specific demographic history affects the distribution of IBD segment lengths</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Understanding these population-specific performance differences is particularly important when working in diverse contexts or with historically marginalized communities. Using multiple methods helps mitigate potential biases in any single approach.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
            <p>As you implement and compare multiple IBD detection methods in this lab, consider these broader implications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Methodological Humility:</strong> The differences between methods remind us that all computational approaches have limitations</li>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Integration:</strong> Genetic evidence, even when computationally robust, should be integrated with historical, anthropological, and community knowledge</li>
                <li><strong>Explanatory Responsibility:</strong> Being able to explain why different methods may give different results is crucial when communicating findings</li>
                <li><strong>Evolving Approaches:</strong> The field continues to develop new algorithms, and today's state-of-the-art may be supplemented by even better methods in the future</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These considerations connect the technical implementation of IBD detection to its broader scholarly context and social impact, particularly in applications related to community identity, historical recovery, and ancestral connections.</p>
