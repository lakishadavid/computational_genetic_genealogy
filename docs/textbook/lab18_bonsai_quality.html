                <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Data quality in genetic genealogy is not merely a technical concern but a profound ethical responsibility. The integrity of genetic data directly impacts whose ancestral connections are prioritized, whose histories are reconstructed accurately, and whose identities are validated. For communities seeking to reconnect ancestral ties disrupted by historical trauma—whether through slavery, forced adoption, or colonial displacement—data quality determines whether computational methods reinforce or help heal historical injustices. Understanding the politics of data quality is essential for conducting genealogical research that respects human dignity and acknowledges the complex social contexts in which genetic relationships exist.</p>

            <h3>The Politics of Data Quality</h3>
            
            <p>Data quality in genetic genealogy is not a neutral technical concept but a deeply political one, reflecting historical patterns of inclusion, exclusion, and valuation of different human populations.</p>
            
            <h4>Quality as Historical Construction</h4>
            
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Issue</th>

                    <td>Deliberate destruction of genealogical records during slavery and colonization</td>
                    <td>Systematic gaps requiring specialized computational approaches</td>
                </tr>

                    <td>Challenges in linking historical records to genetic data</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Documentation Bias</td>
                    <td>Uneven historical documentation privileging certain populations</td>
                    <td>Asymmetric ability to validate computational inferences</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Technological Access</td>
                    <td>Uneven global access to genetic testing technologies</td>
                    <td>Sampling biases affecting whose relationships are represented</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>When we speak of "data quality" in Bonsai, we must recognize that what constitutes "quality" emerges from specific historical contexts. The very metrics we use to assess genetic data quality—coverage, accuracy, completeness—reflect particular priorities that have been shaped by the history of genetics as a discipline.</p>
            
            <p>For communities whose histories have been systematically erased or distorted, conventional quality metrics may fail to capture what matters most. What appears as "low quality" data in standard frameworks may reflect historical injustices rather than technical inadequacies. Addressing data quality in Bonsai therefore requires not just technical solutions but historical consciousness and a commitment to equity in whose genetic histories are valued and preserved.</p>

            <h4>Materiality of Genetic Data</h4>
            
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Material Aspect</th>
                    <th>Cultural/Political Dimension</th>
                    <th>Implications for Quality</th>
                </tr>

                    <td>Sample Collection</td>

                    <td>Data Storage Formats</td>
                    <td>Standardization processes dominated by specific institutions</td>
                    <td>Format incompatibilities reflecting power differentials</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Archival Practices</td>
                    <td>Institutional policies on data preservation</td>
                    <td>Systemic gaps in whose genetic information persists</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>Genetic data exists not as abstract information but as material artifacts created through specific technological processes. The materiality of genetic data—how it's collected, processed, stored, and shared—shapes what counts as "quality" and whose genetic relationships can be effectively analyzed.</p>
            
            <p>The genotyping platforms used to generate data for Bonsai analysis embed particular assumptions about which genetic variants matter. These platforms, developed primarily by commercial entities in the Global North, prioritize variants common in certain populations over others. When we filter IBD segments based on quality scores, we are not applying neutral criteria but engaging with the materialized consequences of these technological choices.</p>
            
            <p>A critically informed approach to data quality in Bonsai requires acknowledging these material conditions and developing preprocessing strategies that compensate for, rather than reinforce, their inherent biases.</p>

            <h3>Filtering as Epistemic Practice</h3>
            
            <p>The process of filtering IBD segments represents more than a technical necessity; it constitutes an epistemic practice that determines what counts as valid evidence of relationship.</p>
            
            <h4>Threshold Setting as Value Judgment</h4>
            
            <p>When we apply length-based thresholds to filter IBD segments, we are making value judgments about which relationships matter. Higher thresholds preferentially retain evidence of closer relationships while eliminating evidence of more distant ones. This is not merely a technical decision but one that embodies particular priorities about which connections are worth preserving in the analysis.</p>
            
            <p>For communities seeking to reconnect distant relations disrupted by historical trauma—such as African Americans tracing connections through slavery or Indigenous peoples reconnecting across generations of forced separation—these filtering choices have profound implications. Standard thresholds optimized for general populations may systematically erase precisely the connections these communities most urgently seek to recover.</p>
            
            <p>The common practice of using 7-8 cM as a "balanced" threshold reflects a particular weighting of false positives against false negatives. But this balance looks different when viewed through the lens of communities for whom each potential connection represents the possible recovery of deliberately severed kinship. A critically informed approach to IBD filtering requires making these value judgments explicit and adapting thresholds to align with the specific goals and contexts of different communities.</p>

            <h4>Population-Specific Adjustments as Cultural Translation</h4>
            
            <p>Population-specific filtering approaches in Bonsai represent attempts to account for different genealogical histories through technical means. When we adjust thresholds based on endogamy factors or reference panel coverage, we are engaging in a form of cultural translation—trying to make the algorithm responsive to diverse historical experiences.</p>
            
            <p>Yet these adjustments often rely on population categories that themselves reflect particular historical constructions. The very act of assigning "endogamy factors" to populations like "Ashkenazi Jewish" or "Finnish" treats these communities as discrete, homogeneous entities rather than dynamic, heterogeneous groups with complex histories. The category "African" as used in these adjustments fails to capture the immense genetic diversity of the continent and its diaspora.</p>
            
            <p>Moreover, the default values assigned to these population adjustment factors embed assumptions about which populations represent the "norm" and which require "correction." European populations are typically assigned the reference value of 1.0, positioning them as the standard against which other populations are measured.</p>
            
            <p>A more critically informed approach would recognize these adjustments not just as technical corrections but as attempts to translate between different genealogical realities, each with its own validity and integrity.</p>

            <h3>Missing Data and Narrative Possibility</h3>
            
            <p>How we handle missing data in Bonsai shapes which ancestral narratives become possible to reconstruct and which remain inaccessible.</p>
            
            <h4>Imputation as Narrative Construction</h4>
            
            <p>When we impute missing attributes in Bonsai, we are engaged in a form of narrative construction—filling gaps in the historical record to create coherent stories of relationship. These imputations are never neutral but reflect particular assumptions about how families should be structured and what constitutes plausible kinship.</p>
            
            <p>Imputing missing sex information based on names or roles, for instance, relies on culturally specific assumptions about gender that may not hold across diverse communities or historical periods. The very categories used in these imputations—binary sex designations, linear age progressions, normative family structures—emerge from particular cultural traditions rather than universal truths about human kinship.</p>
            
            <p>For communities with kinship systems that don't align with these assumptions, such imputation practices may impose inappropriate structures that distort rather than clarify actual relationships. A critically informed approach to imputation would maintain awareness of these limitations and develop more flexible approaches that can accommodate diverse understandings of family structure.</p>

            <h4>Latent Ancestor Inference as Historical Reconstruction</h4>
            
            <p>Bonsai's capacity to infer missing (latent) ancestors represents a powerful tool for communities seeking to reconnect disrupted lineages. This feature acknowledges that the absence of certain individuals from the dataset often reflects historical processes of erasure rather than actual genealogical discontinuity.</p>
            
            <p>For African Americans tracing ancestry through slavery, these latent ancestor inferences may help bridge deliberate historical gaps where names, identities, and records were systematically destroyed. For adoptees seeking biological connections, they may reveal unknown grandparents linking them to broader family networks.</p>
            
            <p>Yet this computational reconstruction of missing ancestors raises profound questions about the relationship between algorithmic inference and historical truth. When Bonsai infers a latent ancestor, what epistemic status should we assign to this entity? Is it a computational convenience, a statistical approximation, or a representation of an actual historical person whose identity has been lost?</p>
            
            <p>These questions take on particular significance in contexts where reconnecting with ancestors carries spiritual, cultural, or political importance beyond mere biological connection. A critically informed approach to latent ancestor inference would engage thoughtfully with these dimensions, recognizing that what appears as "missing data" often reflects specific historical processes of erasure that algorithms alone cannot fully address.</p>

            <h3>Reference Panel Politics</h3>
            
            <p>The reference panels used in genetic phasing and IBD detection embed particular politics of representation that directly impact whose relationships can be accurately reconstructed.</p>
            
            <h4>Panel Construction as Power</h4>
            
            <p>Reference panels used in genetic analysis are not neutral assemblages but reflect specific histories of power and representation. The overrepresentation of European ancestries in these panels results from historical patterns of research investment, consent practices, and institutional priorities rather than scientific necessity.</p>
            
            <p>When we adjust for "reference panel gaps" in Bonsai preprocessing, we are attempting to compensate for these historical disparities. Yet these adjustments often treat the problem as a technical one rather than addressing its root causes in the politics of genetic research.</p>
            
            <p>For communities underrepresented in reference panels, these gaps translate directly into reduced ability to accurately reconstruct their genealogical histories. The adjustment factors applied (e.g., 1.2 for "African" populations) represent approximate corrections that cannot fully compensate for fundamental disparities in whose genetic variation has been thoroughly characterized.</p>
            
            <p>A more structural approach would focus not just on technical adjustments but on transforming the reference panel construction process itself to ensure more equitable representation. This involves addressing questions of consent, community engagement, institutional accountability, and resource allocation that go beyond algorithmic solutions.</p>

            <h4>Cross-Population Analysis as Boundary Crossing</h4>
            
            <p>Analyzing relationships that cross population boundaries presents particular challenges that reveal the constructed nature of these boundaries themselves. When Bonsai applies different thresholds for "same-population" versus "cross-population" pairs, it reinforces particular understandings of human population structure that may not align with the fluid, overlapping nature of actual human groups.</p>
            
            <p>These challenges are especially significant for individuals with mixed ancestry, whose genetic relationships may be systematically underestimated by algorithms trained on more homogeneous reference populations. The very concept of "admixture" embedded in these adjustments frames human genetic diversity through a lens of discrete, pure ancestral populations that "mix"—a framing with deep roots in colonial thinking about race and human difference.</p>
            
            <p>A more critically informed approach would recognize these population boundaries as provisional constructs rather than natural kinds, and would develop more flexible analytical frameworks that can accommodate the complex, overlapping patterns of relationship that characterize actual human communities.</p>

            <h3>Quality Assessment as Cultural Practice</h3>
            
            <p>The metrics and visualizations we use to assess data quality in Bonsai reflect particular cultural understandings of what constitutes valid knowledge.</p>
            
            <h4>Visualization as Cultural Lens</h4>
            
            <p>The quality dashboards and visualizations used in Bonsai preprocessing represent not just technical tools but cultural artifacts that shape how we perceive and value different aspects of genetic data. These visualizations privilege certain ways of seeing—quantitative, abstract, individualized—that emerge from particular traditions of scientific practice.</p>
            
            <p>When we visualize IBD segment length distributions or chromosome coverage, we frame quality in terms that may not capture what matters most to the communities whose relationships are being analyzed. For communities with oral traditions of kinship reckoning, these abstract visualizations may seem disconnected from more meaningful, narrative-based understandings of relationship quality.</p>
            
            <p>A more inclusive approach to quality assessment would explore alternative visualization strategies that could better align with diverse ways of understanding kinship and connection. This might include more narrative-centered visualizations that situate quality metrics within meaningful contexts or approaches that visualize relationships at the community rather than individual level.</p>

            <h4>Community-Centered Quality Frameworks</h4>
            
            <p>Truly responsible quality assessment in Bonsai requires moving beyond standardized metrics toward frameworks that center the specific needs, priorities, and epistemologies of the communities whose relationships are being analyzed.</p>
            
            <p>For communities seeking to reconnect members separated by adoption, for instance, quality might be assessed primarily in terms of the algorithm's ability to identify parent-child relationships with high confidence. For communities tracing connections across diaspora, quality might focus on the reliable detection of more distant relationships across geographic boundaries.</p>
            
            <p>These community-centered frameworks would not replace technical quality assessments but would contextualize them within broader understandings of what constitutes valuable knowledge in different cultural contexts. They would recognize that what counts as "quality" depends not just on statistical properties but on the specific historical, cultural, and political contexts in which genetic analysis is deployed.</p>
            
            <p>A critical approach to quality assessment in Bonsai would therefore begin not with universal metrics but with engagement with the specific communities whose relationships are being analyzed, seeking to understand their priorities, concerns, and ways of knowing.</p>

            <h3>Toward Ethical Preprocessing</h3>
            
            <p>Moving beyond technical considerations, ethical preprocessing in Bonsai requires thoughtful engagement with questions of representation, accountability, and community sovereignty.</p>
            
            <h4>Transparent Filtering Decisions</h4>
            
            <p>Ethical preprocessing begins with transparency about the value judgments embedded in filtering decisions. Rather than presenting thresholds and parameters as purely technical choices, researchers should explicitly acknowledge the priorities and trade-offs these choices reflect.</p>
            
            <p>This transparency includes clear documentation of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why particular thresholds were chosen and what relationships they prioritize</li>
                <li>How population-specific adjustments were determined and what assumptions they embed</li>
                <li>Which individuals or relationships might be systematically disadvantaged by these choices</li>
                <li>Alternative approaches considered and why they were not adopted</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Such transparency enables communities to understand how preprocessing decisions might shape the narratives that emerge from the analysis and to advocate for approaches better aligned with their specific needs and contexts.</p>

            <h4>Community Sovereignty in Data Preparation</h4>
            
            <p>A more profound shift toward ethical preprocessing involves recognizing community sovereignty over the data preparation process itself. Rather than treating preprocessing as a purely technical domain reserved for experts, this approach would create meaningful opportunities for communities to shape how their genetic data is filtered, adjusted, and prepared for analysis.</p>
            
            <p>This might include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborative development of quality metrics that reflect community priorities</li>
                <li>Community input into filtering thresholds based on specific relationship recovery goals</li>
                <li>Integration of community knowledge about family structures to guide imputation strategies</li>
                <li>Community ownership of reference panels derived from their genetic data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Such approaches recognize that communities are not merely subjects of genetic analysis but experts in their own right, with valuable knowledge about their histories, relationships, and priorities that should inform how their genetic data is processed and analyzed.</p>

            <h3>Practical Approaches to Critical Data Quality</h3>
            
            <p>Translating these critical insights into practical preprocessing approaches requires specific strategies that can be implemented within Bonsai's computational framework.</p>
            
            <h4>Culturally Responsive Filtering</h4>
            
            <p>Implementing culturally responsive filtering involves developing more nuanced approaches that can adapt to diverse community contexts and goals:</p>
            
            <p>Rather than applying universal thresholds, a culturally responsive approach would develop flexible filtering strategies based on specific community objectives. For communities primarily concerned with reconnecting immediate family separated by adoption, higher thresholds might be appropriate to ensure high confidence in close relationship inferences. For communities reconstructing connections fragmented by historical trauma across many generations, lower thresholds and higher sensitivity might better serve their needs.</p>
            
            <p>This approach requires engaging directly with communities to understand their specific goals, developing custom filtering configurations for different contexts, and providing transparent documentation of how these choices align with community priorities.</p>

            <h4>Historically Informed Missing Data Strategies</h4>
            
            <p>Addressing missing data in ways that acknowledge its historical causes requires approaches that go beyond standard imputation techniques:</p>
            
            <p>For communities whose genealogical records were deliberately destroyed, as in the case of enslaved ancestors, missing data represents not random gaps but systematic erasure. Historically informed approaches would incorporate specific knowledge about these patterns of erasure to guide how missing data is handled.</p>
            
            <p>This might involve developing specialized imputation models trained on the specific historical contexts of different communities, incorporating historical documentation beyond genetic data to guide imputation, and maintaining epistemic humility about the limits of computational reconstruction in the face of deliberate historical erasure.</p>

            <h4>Equity-Centered Quality Assessment</h4>
            
            <p>Moving beyond standard quality metrics toward more equity-centered assessment involves developing new frameworks that can better capture what matters to diverse communities:</p>
            
            <p>An equity-centered approach would assess quality not just in terms of technical metrics but in terms of how well the analysis serves the specific needs of the communities whose relationships are being analyzed. This might include evaluating how equitably the preprocessing pipeline performs across different populations, how well it preserves connections of particular cultural significance, and how accessible and interpretable its results are to community members.</p>
            
            <p>Such assessment frameworks would be developed collaboratively with the communities they serve, evolving through ongoing dialogue rather than being fixed in advance based on purely technical considerations.</p>

                <li>Critically analyze the population categories used in reference panel adjustments. How might these categories reinforce problematic conceptions of human population structure? Propose alternative approaches that better reflect the complexity and fluidity of human groups.</li>

                <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Data quality in genetic genealogy is never merely a technical matter but always a political and ethical one. The choices we make in preprocessing—which segments to keep, which metrics to prioritize, how to handle missing information—shape whose histories become recoverable and whose remain obscured. As we develop increasingly powerful computational tools like Bonsai, we must bring the same critical attention to our preprocessing practices that we apply to our analytical methods, recognizing that how we prepare data fundamentally shapes what kinds of kinship become visible and valued in our analyses.</p>

            <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
            <p>Quality assessment in genetic genealogy connects to broader questions about evidence evaluation and interpretation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Evidentiary Standards:</strong> How different fields establish thresholds for evidence quality and reliability in relationship determination</li>
                <li><strong>Differential Impacts:</strong> How data quality issues may disproportionately affect underrepresented populations due to reference data limitations</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency in Limitations:</strong> Ethical considerations in communicating the reliability and limitations of genetic relationship inferences</li>
                <li><strong>Integration of Evidence Types:</strong> How computational methods can balance genetic evidence with documentary and oral history sources</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These considerations highlight how technical approaches to data quality assessment intersect with broader ethical and methodological questions about evidence standards in genealogical research and their implications for diverse communities.</p>
