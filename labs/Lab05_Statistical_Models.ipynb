    "\n",
    "1. Probability distributions for IBD segment counts and lengths\n",
    "2. Statistical modeling of different genetic relationships\n",
    "3. Likelihood functions for relationship inference\n",
    "4. Handling the stochastic nature of genetic inheritance\n",
    "5. Bayesian approaches to pedigree reconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you'll understand the mathematical foundations that allow Bonsai v3 to infer relationships from genetic data."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we've explored the statistical models of genetic inheritance used in Bonsai v3. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mathematical Foundations**: IBD segment counts follow a Poisson distribution, while segment lengths follow an exponential distribution. These distributions have parameters that depend on the relationship type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Three-Parameter Model**: Bonsai v3 characterizes relationships using three key parameters: expected segment count (Œª), mean segment length, and IBD2 proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Likelihood Functions**: Relationship inference is done by computing likelihoods of observed IBD statistics under different relationship models, combining evidence from segment counts, total IBD, and IBD2 proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stochasticity**: Due to the random nature of genetic inheritance, there is inherent stochasticity in IBD sharing patterns, even for the same relationship type. This can sometimes lead to ambiguity in relationship inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Inference Accuracy**: The accuracy of relationship inference varies by relationship type, with closer relationships generally being easier to distinguish than more distant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "These statistical foundations allow Bonsai v3 to make principled inferences about relationships from observed IBD patterns, which is the core of its pedigree reconstruction capabilities."
