    "### Why Is It Necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we dive deeper into genetic data analysis, it's important to manage computational resources effectively. Whole-genome VCF files from projects like the 1000 Genomes can be extremely large, often containing data for thousands of individuals across millions of genetic variants. Loading such extensive data into memory can be computationally intensive and may even cause the kernel to crash, as we've experienced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Subsetting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduced Computational Load**: By focusing on a subset of 500 individuals, we significantly reduce the computational resources needed for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Faster Execution**: Smaller datasets mean that code will execute more quickly, allowing us to focus on the analysis rather than waiting for code to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feasibility**: Not all personal computers will have the resources to handle large genomic datasets. Subsetting makes the tutorial more accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Focused Analysis**: With fewer individuals, it's easier to explore the data in depth, which is particularly useful for educational purposes."
