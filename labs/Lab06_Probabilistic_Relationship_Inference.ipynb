    "\n",
    "1. The mathematical framework for relationship inference\n",
    "2. Computing statistical moments for IBD segment distributions\n",
    "3. Building likelihood functions for different relationship types\n",
    "4. Handling uncertainty and stochasticity in relationship inference\n",
    "5. Calibrating models with real-world data\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we've explored the probabilistic relationship inference methods used in Bonsai v3. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relationship Representation**: Bonsai v3 uses a tuple representation for relationships, which captures the genealogical structure, meiotic distance, and number of common ancestors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Statistical Moments**: Three key parameters characterize IBD distributions for different relationships: lambda (segment length distribution), eta (expected segment count), and total IBD sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Likelihood Functions**: Bonsai v3 builds likelihood functions to calculate the probability of observed IBD patterns given different relationships, combining evidence from segment counts and lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Stochasticity**: Due to the random nature of genetic inheritance, relationship inference includes quantifying uncertainty through likelihood ratios and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bayesian Framework**: The relationship inference process follows a Bayesian framework, combining likelihoods with priors to calculate posterior probabilities for different relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "These probabilistic methods allow Bonsai v3 to make robust inferences about relationships from IBD data, providing the foundation for pedigree reconstruction even with incomplete and noisy genetic data."
