# Getting Started

## Our Coding Environmet

To get started, we need to set up a coding environment that provides all the necessary tools for efficient and productive development. This involves installing essential software like Visual Studio Code (VSCode), Git, and Docker, which form the foundation of our workflow. **VSCode** serves as a versatile code editor with features like debugging, integrated terminal, and extensions to enhance our development experience. **Git** is indispensable for version control, allowing us to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage our code efficiently. **Docker** ensures a consistent environment by containerizing applications, making it easier to run, test, and deploy code across different systems. By setting up this coding environment, we ensure a smooth and streamlined development process right from the start.
