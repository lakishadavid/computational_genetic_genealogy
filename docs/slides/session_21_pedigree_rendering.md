# Session 21: Pedigree Rendering and Visualization (rendering.py)

## Session Overview
This session focuses on pedigree visualization techniques implemented in Bonsai v3's `rendering.py` module, examining how complex pedigree structures are transformed into interpretable visual representations.

## Key Topics

### 1. Pedigree Visualization Challenges
- Complexity of genealogical graph visualization
- Balancing clarity and completeness
- Representing different relationship types
- Handling large and complex pedigrees
- User interface considerations

### 2. The `rendering.py` Module Structure
- Design philosophy and implementation approach
- Key components and functions
- External dependencies and integration
- Configuration options and customization
- Output formats supported

### 3. From Up-Node Dictionary to Visual Graph
- Translation process overview:
  1. Convert up-node dictionary to graph structure
  2. Apply layout algorithms
  3. Generate visual elements
  4. Render final visualization
- Implementation details and algorithms
- Handling of inferred vs. observed individuals

### 4. Layout Algorithms for Pedigrees
- Hierarchical layout strategies
- Generational alignment approaches
- Sibling grouping and ordering
- Handling complex structures:
  - Multiple marriages
  - Half-relationships
  - Cycles and complex connections
- Implementation of layout functions

### 5. Visual Elements and Encoding
- Standard genealogical symbols and conventions
- Node representations:
  - Sex-specific shapes
  - Observed vs. inferred styling
  - Age and other attribute encoding
- Edge representations:
  - Parent-child connections
  - Marriage/partnership links
  - Styling for relationship types
- Implementation details and customization

### 6. Interactive Visualization Features
- Zoom and pan functionality
- Expand/collapse for complex structures
- Hover information and tooltips
- Selection and highlighting
- Integration with browser-based interfaces

### 7. Visualization Libraries and Integration
- Use of visualization libraries:
  - NetworkX for graph representation
  - Matplotlib for static visualization
  - D3.js for interactive web visualization
- Integration approach and adapters
- Performance considerations

### 8. Export Formats and Interoperability
- Static image formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)
- Interactive formats (HTML, JavaScript)
- Standard genealogical formats (GEDCOM)
- Custom JSON representation
- Implementation of export functions

### 9. Scalability in Visualization
- Handling very large pedigrees
- Incremental and partial rendering
- Level-of-detail approaches
- Performance optimizations
- Memory efficiency techniques

### 10. Annotation and Metadata Visualization
- Displaying confidence scores
- Highlighting uncertain relationships
- Showing genetic evidence information
- Integrating demographic data
- Implementation of annotation functions

## Practical Components
- Implementing basic pedigree visualization
- Creating different visual styles for pedigrees
- Handling complex pedigree structures
- Integrating visualization with analysis results

## Recommended Reading
- Graph visualization literature
- Genealogical visualization standards
- Papers on large graph layout algorithms
- UI/UX design for complex data visualization
- Implementation techniques for interactive visualization

## Next Session
In our next meeting, we'll examine methods for interpreting pedigree reconstruction results and evaluating confidence measures in relationship inference.
