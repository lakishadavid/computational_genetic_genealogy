            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p><strong>Core Component:</strong> This lab explores how Bonsai v3 efficiently adds new individuals to existing pedigrees one at a time, rather than rebuilding the entire structure. These incremental addition strategies are critical for performance when working with large datasets and for updating pedigrees as new genetic data becomes available.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Challenge of Incremental Addition</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Why Incremental Addition Matters</h4>
                <p>In real-world genetic genealogy applications, data often arrives incrementally. New individuals may take DNA tests and need to be placed in an existing family structure without recomputing the entire pedigree. Bonsai v3 addresses this challenge through specialized functions that efficiently find optimal placement for new individuals within existing pedigrees.</p>
                
                <p>The key advantages of incremental addition include:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Computational Efficiency:</strong> Adding one individual is much faster than rebuilding an entire pedigree</li>
                    <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Existing relationships in the pedigree remain stable as new individuals are added</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The approach can handle continuous addition of new individuals over time</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-time Updates:</strong> Results can be updated promptly as new data becomes available</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>The core of this functionality in Bonsai v3 is the <code>add_individual_to_pedigree</code> function:</p>
                
                <pre><code>def add_individual_to_pedigree(

    id_to_info: dict[int, dict],

                <p>This function orchestrates the process of finding the optimal way to add a new individual to an existing pedigree. It evaluates different potential connection points and relationship configurations, much like the pedigree merging process we saw previously, but optimized for the single-individual case.</p>

                <h4>Finding Potential Connection Points</h4>
                <p>The first step in adding a new individual to a pedigree is to identify potential connection points. This is handled by the <code>find_potential_connection_points</code> function:</p>

            continue

    return connection_points</code></pre>
                
                <p>This function identifies individuals in the existing pedigree who share IBD with the new individual. These individuals form the potential connection points through which the new individual can be added to the pedigree. The function sorts these connection points by the amount of IBD sharing, prioritizing stronger genetic connections.</p>
                
                <p>The key insight here is that individuals who share more IBD with the new individual are likely to be more closely related, making them better candidates for connection points. By focusing on these high-IBD connections first, Bonsai can often find the optimal placement more efficiently.</p>

                <p>This function builds a pedigree incrementally by adding individuals one at a time in a specific order. The key steps are:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Identifying all individuals from the IBD data</li>

                <p>This incremental approach allows Bonsai to efficiently build large pedigrees that would be computationally infeasible to optimize directly.

                <p><strong>Core Component:</strong> Incremental individual addition is a critical optimization in Bonsai v3 that enables efficient pedigree reconstruction at scale. By adding individuals one at a time to an existing pedigree, rather than rebuilding the entire structure, Bonsai can handle large datasets and continuous updates with new genetic data. The sophisticated algorithms for finding optimal placements and efficiently evaluating different options allow Bonsai to maintain accuracy while dramatically reducing computational costs.</p>

            <p>The Lab17 notebook explores incremental individual addition strategies through simplified implementations and examples. While the notebook provides an educational introduction to the key concepts, the actual Bonsai v3 implementation includes additional sophistication:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sophisticated Ordering Strategies:</strong> The production code includes advanced algorithms for determining the optimal order in which to add individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Parallel Evaluation:</strong> The real implementation can evaluate multiple placement options in parallel for better performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Metadata Integration:</strong> More comprehensive integration of non-genetic information (age, sex, etc.) in the placement process.</li>
                <li><strong>Caching and Memoization:</strong> The production code includes sophisticated caching mechanisms to avoid redundant computations.</li>
                <li><strong>Error Recovery:</strong> More robust handling of edge cases and ability to recover from sub-optimal placements.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These differences allow the production implementation to handle the full complexity of real-world pedigree reconstruction tasks, while the notebook provides a more accessible introduction to the core concepts.</p>

<h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
            <p>As you explore incremental individual addition strategies, consider these broader implications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Growing Datasets:</strong> How these techniques enable analysis of ever-growing genetic genealogy databases</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptive Pedigree Building:</strong> The potential for continuously updating pedigrees as new data becomes available</li>
                <li><strong>Ordering Strategies:</strong> The impact of different individual addition orders on the resulting pedigree structure</li>
                <li><strong>Balancing Accuracy and Performance:</strong> The trade-offs involved in optimizing for efficient additions</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> How incremental approaches can adjust to new evidence without requiring complete recomputation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These considerations highlight how incremental individual addition strategies are not just technical optimizations but fundamental enablers of large-scale pedigree reconstruction from genetic data.</p>
