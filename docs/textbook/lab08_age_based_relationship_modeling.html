                <p><strong>Core Component:</strong> This lab explores how Bonsai v3 incorporates age information to enhance relationship inference. While genetic data provides strong evidence for biological relationships, age information can help resolve ambiguities and improve accuracy, especially for relationships with similar genetic signatures.</p>

            <h3>The Role of Age in Genetic Genealogy</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Why Age Matters</h4>
                <p>Age information is a powerful complement to genetic data in relationship inference for several reasons:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Disambiguation:</strong> Some relationships have similar genetic signatures but different expected age differences (e.g., grandparent vs. aunt/uncle)</li>
                    <li><strong>Biological Constraints:</strong> Age differences can render certain relationships biologically impossible (e.g., a younger person cannot be a parent of an older person)</li>
                    <li><strong>Generation Inference:</strong> Age patterns can help determine generational structure in complex pedigrees</li>
                    <li><strong>Resolution of Uncertainty:</strong> When genetic evidence is ambiguous, age can tip the scales toward the correct relationship</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Bonsai v3's age-based modeling system is implemented primarily within the <code>PwLogLike</code> class we explored in Lab 07, but with specialized methods focusing on age-based likelihood computation.</p>
                
                <p>The key aging-related methods in the production code include:</p>
                <pre><code>get_pw_age_ll()      # Calculate age-based log-likelihood for a relationship
_get_age_parameters() # Get expected age difference for a relationship
_get_age_weight()     # Calculate weight for age evidence
_validate_age_info()  # Check if age information is biologically plausible</code></pre>
                
                <p>These methods work together to extract relationship evidence from age data and integrate it with genetic evidence for comprehensive relationship inference.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Age Difference Distributions in Bonsai v3</h4>
                <p>Bonsai v3 models age differences between relatives using normal (Gaussian) distributions, where the parameters (mean and standard deviation) depend on the specific relationship type. The implementation is grounded in demographic research on typical age differences in family structures.</p>
                
                <p>The core function for retrieving age parameters is <code>_get_age_parameters()</code>, which returns relationship-specific parameters:</p>

    return result</code></pre>
                
                <p>The parameters encode three key pieces of information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>mean:</strong> The expected age difference in years (positive if id1 should be older, negative if id2 should be older)</li>
                    <li><strong>std_dev:</strong> The standard deviation of the age difference distribution, capturing the natural variation</li>
                    <li><strong>direction:</strong> A flag indicating whether there's a directional constraint (e.g., parents must be older than children)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>These parameters are calibrated based on extensive demographic research and validation against real family datasets. For example, the average parent-child age difference of 30 years with a standard deviation of 10 years has been found to be consistent across various populations, though with some cultural and historical variations.</p>

            <h3>Age-Based Likelihood Calculation</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Computing Age-Based Likelihoods</h4>
                <p>Once the age parameters are determined for a relationship, Bonsai v3 calculates the likelihood of the observed age difference under that relationship hypothesis using the <code>get_pw_age_ll()</code> method:</p>
                
                <pre><code>def get_pw_age_ll(self, id1, id2, relationship_tuple):

    age2 = self.id_to_info[id2].get('age')
    
    if age1 is None or age2 is None:
        return 0.0  # No age information available
    
    # Calculate age difference
    age_diff = age1 - age2
    
    # Get expected age parameters for this relationship
    params = self._get_age_parameters(relationship_tuple)

        return float('-inf')  # Biologically impossible
    elif direction == -1 and age_diff > -16:  # id1 should be younger by at least 16 years
        return float('-inf')  # Biologically impossible
    
    # Calculate log-likelihood using normal distribution
    return stats.norm.logpdf(age_diff, mean, std_dev)</code></pre>
                
                <p>The method follows these key steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Retrieve age information for both individuals</li>
                    <li>Calculate the age difference (id1's age minus id2's age)</li>
                    <li>Get the expected age parameters for the proposed relationship</li>
                    <li>Apply biological constraints (e.g., parents must be at least 16 years older than children)</li>
                    <li>Calculate the log-likelihood using a normal distribution</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>The use of log-likelihoods (rather than regular likelihoods) is important for numerical stability and makes it easier to combine with genetic likelihoods, which are also calculated in log space.</p>
                
                <p>The biological impossibility check is particularly important, as it completely rules out relationships that violate fundamental biological constraints, regardless of genetic evidence. This helps prevent errors where genetic noise might otherwise lead to biologically impossible relationship inferences.</p>

                <h4>Handling Missing and Uncertain Age Information</h4>
                <p>Real-world data often includes missing or uncertain age information. Bonsai v3 implements several strategies to handle these scenarios:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Neutral Contribution for Missing Data:</strong> When age information is missing for one or both individuals, the age-based component doesn't contribute to the final likelihood (returns 0 in log space)</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Incorporating Uncertainty:</strong> When age information is uncertain (e.g., approximate birth years), the standard deviation is increased to reflect this uncertainty:</li>
                </ol>
                
                <pre><code>def _adjust_age_uncertainty(self, id1, id2, std_dev):
    """Adjust standard deviation based on age uncertainty.
    
    Args:

    # Combine uncertainties with base standard deviation
    # Using sum of variances for independent random variables
    combined_var = std_dev**2 + uncertainty1**2 + uncertainty2**2
    adjusted_std = math.sqrt(combined_var)
    
    return adjusted_std</code></pre>
                
                <p>For partial age information, Bonsai v3 can sometimes extract weak evidence. For example, if only one individual's age is known, but the relationship has a strong directional constraint (like parent-child), a partial assessment can still be made.</p>
                
                <p>The system can also infer age ranges based on known relationships. For instance, if A is known to be a parent of B, and B's age is known to be 30, then A's age can be estimated to be approximately 60 (with appropriate variance).</p>
                
                <p>This sophisticated handling of age uncertainty ensures that the system makes the best use of available information without being overconfident in its inferences.</p>

                <p>Genetically, these relationships are difficult to distinguish, especially with limited data. However, they have distinct age difference patterns:</p>

                    <li>Half siblings: Mean age difference close to 0 years</li>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Sex-Specific Age Models</h4>
                <p>Bonsai v3's production code includes sex-specific age models that account for biological sex differences in reproductive patterns. For example, the timing of parenthood tends to differ between males and females:</p>
                
                <pre><code>def _get_sex_specific_age_parameters(self, relationship_tuple, sex1, sex2):
    """Get sex-specific age parameters for a relationship.
    
    Args:
        relationship_tuple: (up, down, num_ancs) tuple
        sex1, sex2: Biological sex of individuals ('M', 'F', or None)
        
    Returns:
        Adjusted age parameters
    """
    # Get base parameters
    params = self._get_age_parameters(relationship_tuple)
    
    # No sex information or not a relationship where it matters
    if sex1 is None or sex2 is None:
        return params
        
    up, down, num_ancs = relationship_tuple
    
    # Adjust parent-child relationships
    if up == 0 and down == 1:  # id1 is parent of id2
        if sex1 == 'M':  # Father-child
            params['mean'] += 3  # Fathers tend to be slightly older
        elif sex1 == 'F':  # Mother-child
            params['mean'] -= 3  # Mothers tend to be slightly younger
            params['std_dev'] -= 1  # With less variance
            
    elif up == 1 and down == 0:  # id1 is child of id2
        if sex2 == 'M':  # Child-father
            params['mean'] -= 3  # Inverse of above
        elif sex2 == 'F':  # Child-mother
            params['mean'] += 3
            params['std_dev'] -= 1
    
    # [Additional relationship-specific adjustments...]
    
    return params</code></pre>
                
                <p>These sex-specific adjustments are based on demographic research showing systematic differences in parental age patterns between males and females across many populations. They are particularly valuable for distinguishing maternal from paternal relationships when both genetic and age evidence are available.</p>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Cultural and Historical Calibration</h4>
                <p>The age models in Bonsai v3 can be calibrated for different populations and historical periods. This is important because age patterns vary across cultures and have changed over time. The implementation includes parameters that can be adjusted based on population context:</p>
                
                <pre><code>def _adjust_for_population_context(self, params, population_context):

        params: Base age parameters
        population_context: Dictionary with context information
        
    Returns:
        Adjusted parameters
    """
    # No context information
    if not population_context:
        return params
        
    # Extract context information
    era = population_context.get('era')
    culture = population_context.get('culture')
    
    # Historical era adjustments
    if era == 'pre_1900':
        # Earlier parenthood in historical eras
        if params['direction'] != 0:  # Parent-child related
            params['mean'] *= 0.85  # About 15% younger
            
    elif era == 'post_1980':
        # Later parenthood in modern era
        if params['direction'] != 0:  # Parent-child related
            params['mean'] *= 1.1  # About 10% older
    
    # Cultural adjustments
    if culture in ['A', 'B', 'C']:  # Specific cultural patterns
        # Apply culture-specific adjustments
        adjustment_factor = CULTURE_ADJUSTMENTS.get(culture, 1.0)
        params['mean'] *= adjustment_factor
    
    return params</code></pre>
                
                <p>These contextual adjustments make Bonsai v3's age modeling system adaptable to diverse genealogical scenarios, from modern populations to historical pedigree reconstruction where age patterns may differ significantly from contemporary norms.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-success">
                <p><strong>Core Component:</strong> Bonsai v3's age-based relationship modeling provides a powerful complement to genetic evidence, helping to resolve ambiguities and improve relationship inference accuracy. By modeling age differences as relationship-specific normal distributions and integrating them with genetic evidence through a weighted likelihood approach, the system leverages all available information for more accurate pedigree reconstruction.</p>

            <h3>Comparing Notebook and Production Code</h3>
            
            <p>The Lab08 notebook provides a simplified exploration of age-based relationship modeling, while the production implementation in Bonsai v3 includes additional sophistication:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>More Nuanced Age Models:</strong> The production code includes finer-grained age models for a wider range of relationships</li>
                <li><strong>Population-Specific Calibration:</strong> Parameters can be adjusted for different population contexts</li>
                <li><strong>Sex-Specific Adjustments:</strong> Different age patterns for males and females in reproductive relationships</li>
                <li><strong>Handling of Uncertain Ages:</strong> Sophisticated treatment of age ranges and approximate birth years</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Weight Adjustment:</strong> Age evidence weight varies based on relationship type and evidence quality</li>
                <li><strong>Biological Validity Checking:</strong> More sophisticated checks for biologically impossible age combinations</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The notebook provides a valuable introduction to the key concepts, but the production implementation represents years of refinement to handle the complexities of real-world demographic patterns across diverse human populations.</p>

<h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
            <p>As you explore age-based relationship modeling, consider these broader implications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Evidence Integration:</strong> How combining different types of evidence can lead to more robust inferences than any single source</li>
                <li><strong>Demographic Patterns:</strong> The importance of understanding human demographic patterns in genetic genealogy</li>
                <li><strong>Modeling Uncertainty:</strong> How statistical distributions can represent natural variation in biological and social patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Contextual Calibration:</strong> The need to adapt models to different historical and cultural contexts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These considerations highlight how age-based modeling represents not just a technical enhancement but a bridge between genetic data and human demographic patterns, connecting the molecular to the social aspects of genealogy.</p>
