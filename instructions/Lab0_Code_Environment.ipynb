    "# Introduction to Code Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Code Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **code environment** is the structured setup in which software applications run, including dependencies, libraries, and configurations necessary for execution. Code environments ensure that software behaves consistently across different machines and operating systems, preventing issues related to dependency conflicts and system inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do Code Environments Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reproducibility** – Ensures that code runs the same way across different systems, facilitating collaboration and research reproducibility.\n",
    "- **Dependency Management** – Prevents conflicts between different software packages by isolating dependencies.\n",
    "- **System Stability** – Protects the main operating system from unnecessary installations and modifications.\n",
    "- **Scalability** – Makes it easier to scale applications across multiple machines, cloud environments, or containerized deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual Environments with Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Our class is using **Poetry**, a modern dependency management tool for Python that simplifies package installation, versioning, and virtual environment creation. Poetry offers an elegant solution by combining dependency management and virtual environment creation into a single workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Poetry?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automated Virtual Environments** – Poetry automatically creates and manages virtual environments for projects.\n",
    "- **Simplified Dependency Management** – Uses a `pyproject.toml` file instead of a `requirements.txt`, making package tracking more structured.\n",
    "- **Reproducibility** – The `poetry.lock` file ensures that everyone working on the project installs the exact same package versions.\n",
    "- **Seamless Package Publishing** – Poetry simplifies the process of building and publishing Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Poetry Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| `poetry new my_project` | Creates a new Poetry project with a `pyproject.toml` file |\n",
    "| `poetry install` | Installs dependencies and sets up the virtual environment |\n",
    "| `poetry add <package>` | Adds a new package to the project |\n",
    "| `poetry remove <package>` | Removes a package from the project |\n",
    "| `poetry shell` | Activates the project's virtual environment |\n",
    "| `poetry run <command>` | Runs a command inside the virtual environment |\n",
    "| `poetry lock` | Locks the dependencies to exact versions for consistency |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker: Containerized Code Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "While Poetry helps manage dependencies within Python projects, **Docker** provides an alternative approach by encapsulating an entire system environment, including the OS, into a container. Unlike virtual environments, which only manage dependencies at the application level, Docker offers a complete solution for deploying applications across different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Docker:\n",
    "- **Portability** – Containers run identically on any system with Docker installed.\n",
    "- **Isolation** – Each container runs independently, preventing dependency conflicts.\n",
    "- **Scalability** – Facilitates cloud-based and microservices architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Poetry vs. Docker:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature            | Poetry (Virtual Environment) | Docker (Containerization) |\n",
    "|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| **Scope**         | Manages Python dependencies within a project | Encapsulates the entire OS and software stack |\n",
    "| **Reproducibility** | Ensures consistent package versions | Provides full OS-level consistency |\n",
    "| **Portability**   | Works across Python projects on the same system | Runs across different machines and cloud platforms |\n",
    "| **Resource Usage** | Lightweight | Slightly heavier due to system overhead |\n",
    "| **Best Use Case** | Managing dependencies for Python projects | Deploying applications in diverse environments |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker Environment: Ubuntu 22.04\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Docker setup, we are using **Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)** as the base environment. This ensures consistency across different systems and provides a stable, long-term support (LTS) release with security updates and package support until **April 2027**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Ubuntu 22.04?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Long-Term Support (LTS)** – Ubuntu 22.04 is an LTS release, ensuring reliability and security updates for an extended period.\n",
    "- **Stability and Compatibility** – It is widely used in cloud computing, machine learning, and development environments, making it an ideal choice for reproducible research and software deployment.\n",
    "- **Lightweight and Efficient** – The minimal Ubuntu image is optimized for running applications in containers without unnecessary overhead.\n",
    "- **Extensive Package Support** – Ubuntu provides access to a vast software ecosystem, ensuring compatibility with necessary tools and dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using **Ubuntu 22.04** within Docker, we establish a controlled environment that minimizes discrepancies between development, testing, and production systems, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ensuring You Are Using the Latest Docker Image\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain consistency and take advantage of the most up-to-date dependencies and security patches, it is important to ensure you are running the latest version of the **Ubuntu 22.04**-based Docker image. This prevents issues caused by outdated packages and ensures alignment with the current development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pulling the Latest Image\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running a container, always pull the latest version of the image by executing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker pull lakishadavid/cgg_image:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command fetches the most recent version of the **cgg_image**, ensuring you are using the most up-to-date environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Docker Container\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have pulled the latest image, start a container interactively with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -it lakishadavid/cgg_image:latest bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command:\n",
    "- **Runs** a new container from the latest image.\n",
    "- **Opens an interactive terminal (`-it`)** to allow direct interaction with the container.\n",
    "- **Launches a Bash shell** so you can execute commands within the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you ensure that your development environment is always using the most recent and properly configured version of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exiting the Docker Container\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have finished working inside the Docker container, you will need to exit properly. There are multiple ways to leave the container depending on whether you want to stop it entirely or keep it running in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exit and Stop the Container\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to exit a Docker container is by using the `exit` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "exit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will terminate the container and return you to your local terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Should You Stop a Container?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopping a container is necessary when:\n",
    "- You **no longer need** the application or environment running.\n",
    "- You want to **free up system resources** being used by the container.\n",
    "- You need to **apply updates** or modifications before restarting the container.\n",
    "- You want to **preserve changes** made inside the container so they are available the next time you start it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the container is still running in the background, you can stop it from your terminal using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker stop <container_id>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a clean development workflow, it is good practice to stop containers when they are no longer needed, rather than letting them consume system resources indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-structured code environment is essential for ensuring software **stability**, **reproducibility**, and **efficiency**. In our setup:\n",
    "- **Poetry** simplifies dependency and virtual environment management, ensuring consistency across Python projects.\n",
    "- **Docker** provides an isolated, reproducible system environment, making it ideal for deploying applications across different machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding when to use each tool helps streamline development workflows. **Poetry** is best suited for managing dependencies within a Python project, while **Docker** ensures complete system encapsulation for broader deployment and portability needs. By combining both tools effectively, we create an environment that supports seamless collaboration, minimal dependency conflicts, and efficient software deployment."

    "## Responsibility for the Code Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "While I will maintain the **Docker environment**, the focus of this class is on **running and understanding the genomic analysis code itself**. The Docker image provides a controlled and reproducible environment, ensuring that all necessary dependencies are pre-installed and configured correctly. By using Docker, you eliminate potential compatibility issues and can focus on the **analysis and interpretation of genomic data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing How to Maintain Your Code Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Students have two options for managing their code environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use the Provided Docker Image**  \n",
    "   - I will maintain and update the Docker image to ensure compatibility and reproducibility.\n",
    "   - If you encounter any issues while using Docker, I will troubleshoot and resolve the problem.\n",
    "   - Using the Docker environment ensures that you are working in the exact same setup as me and others using the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintain Your Own Code Environment**  \n",
    "   - If you choose **not to use Docker**, you are responsible for setting up and maintaining your own code environment.\n",
    "   - You must ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible with the provided code.\n",
    "   - If issues arise due to your custom environment, I will offer support, but it is ultimately your responsibility to resolve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Setup for Non-Docker Users\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to work **outside of Docker**, you must manually install the required dependencies. The following code blocks have already been completed **within the Docker image**, meaning Docker users **do not need to run them**. However, **non-Docker users must run the following setup commands themselves** to ensure their environment is configured correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Notes:\n",
    "- The provided code blocks assume you are running **Ubuntu 22.04**.\n",
    "- If you are using a different system, you must adapt the installation steps accordingly.\n",
    "- While I can answer general questions about dependencies, my responsibility is to **maintain the code base within the Docker image**. Your responsibility is to effectively use that image—**either by running it directly or by correctly configuring your own system.**\n",
