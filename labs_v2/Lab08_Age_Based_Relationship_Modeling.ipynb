    "\n",
    "This lab explores how Bonsai v3 incorporates age information to enhance relationship inference. While genetic data provides strong evidence for biological relationships, age information can help resolve ambiguities and improve accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key topics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Age difference distributions for different relationship types\n",
    "2. Age constraints and biological impossibilities\n",
    "3. Computing age-based relationship likelihoods\n",
    "4. Combining age and genetic evidence\n",
    "5. Handling missing or uncertain age information\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you'll understand how age modeling complements genetic data to create more accurate pedigree reconstructions."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we've explored how Bonsai v3 uses age information to enhance relationship inference. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Age Difference Distributions**: Different relationship types have characteristic age difference distributions, modeled as normal distributions with specific mean and standard deviation parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Age-Based Likelihood Calculation**: Bonsai v3 calculates the likelihood of a relationship based on the observed age difference compared to the expected distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling Missing and Uncertain Data**: The system can handle missing age information and incorporates uncertainty in age estimates through adjusted standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combining Evidence**: Age-based likelihoods are combined with genetic likelihoods to provide a more complete assessment of relationship probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Disambiguation Power**: Age information is particularly valuable for disambiguating relationships with similar genetic signatures, such as half-siblings, avuncular relationships, and grandparent-grandchild relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age-based relationship modeling allows Bonsai v3 to leverage all available evidence for relationship inference, producing more accurate and comprehensive pedigree reconstructions than would be possible from genetic data alone."
