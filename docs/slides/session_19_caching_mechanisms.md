# Session 19: Caching Mechanisms for Computational Efficiency (caching.py)

## Session Overview
This session provides an in-depth exploration of the caching mechanisms implemented in Bonsai v3's `caching.py` module, which significantly enhance computational efficiency for repeated operations.

## Key Topics

- Design philosophy and implementation approach
- Key components and classes
- Integration with other system modules
- Configuration and tuning options
- Performance impact measurements

### 3. Relationship Likelihood Caching
- Caching structure for likelihood calculations:
  ```python
  # Example cache structure for relationship likelihoods
  _likelihood_cache = {
      (id1, id2, rel_tuple): log_likelihood_value,
      # ... additional cached values
  }
  ```
- Cache key design and hash efficiency
- Handling parameter variations
- Invalidation strategies
- Memory footprint control

### 4. IBD Statistic Caching
- Caching IBD computations between pairs
- Implementation details:
  ```python
  # Example IBD statistic cache
  _ibd_stat_cache = {
      (id1, id2): {
          'total_half': 75.3,
          'total_full': 12.1,
          'num_half': 8,
          'num_full': 1,
          'max_seg_cm': 23.4
      },
      # ... additional pairs
  }
  ```
- Update patterns during pedigree construction
- Consistency guarantees
- Performance benefits analysis

### 5. Function-Level Caching with Decorators
- Implementation of caching decorators:
  ```python
  @cache_results
  def expensive_function(param1, param2):
      # Function body
      return result
  ```
- Parameter handling and cache keys
- Decorator implementation details
- Application to specific functions
- Performance impact and usage patterns

### 6. Pedigree Fragment Caching
- Caching common pedigree substructures
- Implementation approach:
  ```python
  # Example pedigree fragment cache
  _pedigree_fragment_cache = {
      fragment_hash: (up_node_dict_fragment, log_likelihood),
      # ... additional fragments
  }
  ```
- Hash function for pedigree fragments
- Retrieval and matching algorithms
- Memory considerations for large pedigrees

### 7. Cache Management Strategies
- Size limits and eviction policies

- Concurrent access patterns
- Performance impacts of synchronization
- Optimizations for parallel execution

### 9. Cache Persistence and Serialization
- Saving and loading caches between runs
