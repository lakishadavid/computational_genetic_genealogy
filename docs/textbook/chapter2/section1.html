            <p>Computational genetic genealogy requires processing large datasets, running complex analyses, and ensuring reproducible results. To achieve this effectively, we need a robust and consistent development environment. This chapter guides you through setting up the essential tools that will form the foundation of your computational workflow.</p>

            <div class="tool-box">
                <h3>Our Coding Environment</h3>
                <p>We'll set up three core tools that work together to create a powerful development environment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visual Studio Code (VSCode):</strong> A modern code editor that provides an integrated development environment with features crucial for genetic data analysis, including Python support, debugging capabilities, and extensions for handling various data formats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Git:</strong> A version control system that helps track changes in your code and analysis scripts. In genetic genealogy research, where analyses often evolve and require collaboration, Git ensures you can maintain different versions of your analysis pipelines and share your work effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Docker:</strong> A containerization platform that ensures your analysis environment remains consistent. This is particularly important in genetic genealogy, where analyses often depend on specific software versions and configurations. Docker containers help make your research reproducible across different systems.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="learning-objectives">
                <h3>What You'll Learn</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Install and configure Git for version control</li>
                    <li>Set up VSCode with essential extensions</li>
                    <li>Clone the course repository</li>
                    <li>Install Docker and understand containerization</li>
                    <li>Build and run the course container</li>
                    <li>Manage your data and backups effectively</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="importance-section">
                <h3>Why This Setup Matters</h3>
                <p>Genetic genealogy analyses often involve:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Processing large genomic datasets</li>
                    <li>Running complex statistical analyses</li>
                    <li>Maintaining reproducible research workflows</li>
                    <li>Collaborating with other researchers</li>
                    <li>Keeping track of multiple analysis versions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our chosen development environment addresses these challenges by providing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consistent software versions across different computers</li>
                    <li>Version control for tracking analysis changes</li>
                    <li>Efficient tools for code development and debugging</li>
                    <li>A reproducible environment for sharing work</li>
                </ul>
