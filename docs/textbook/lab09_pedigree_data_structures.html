                <p><strong>Core Component:</strong> This lab explores the fundamental data structures used in Bonsai v3 to represent and manipulate pedigrees. Understanding these structures is essential because they form the foundation for all pedigree operations, from building and querying to optimization and rendering.</p>

            <h3>Fundamental Pedigree Representations</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Node Dictionary Approach</h4>
                <p>At the heart of Bonsai v3's pedigree representation is a dictionary-based approach that efficiently encodes genealogical relationships. The system uses two complementary dictionary structures:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>up_node_dict:</strong> Maps individuals to their ancestors with degrees of relationship</li>
                    <li><strong>down_node_dict:</strong> Maps individuals to their descendants with degrees of relationship</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>These dictionaries offer several advantages over alternative representations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Efficient lookup of relatives in O(1) time</li>
                    <li>Memory-efficient representation of sparse pedigrees</li>
                    <li>Natural handling of missing data and complex pedigree structures</li>
                    <li>Support for both genotyped and ungenotyped (inferred) individuals</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Let's examine the structure of the <code>up_node_dict</code>, the primary representation used in Bonsai v3:</p>
                
                <pre><code>up_node_dict = {
    3: {1: 1, 2: 1},  # Individual 3 has parents 1 and 2, with degree 1
    4: {1: 1, 2: 1},  # Individual 4 has parents 1 and 2, with degree 1
    1: {},            # Individual 1 has no parents in this pedigree
    2: {}             # Individual 2 has no parents in this pedigree
}</code></pre>
                
                <p>In this dictionary:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each key is an individual's ID (positive for genotyped, negative for ungenotyped)</li>
                    <li>Each value is a dictionary mapping parent IDs to relationship degrees</li>
                    <li>The relationship degree is typically 1 for direct parents</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Bonsai v3 also maintains a parallel <code>down_node_dict</code> that provides the reverse mapping, from parents to children. These dictionaries can be converted between each other using the <code>reverse_node_dict()</code> function:</p>
                
                <pre><code>def reverse_node_dict(node_dict):
    """Convert between up_node_dict and down_node_dict.
    
    Args:
        node_dict: Dictionary mapping nodes to their relatives
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with the reverse mapping
    """
    reverse_dict = {}
    
    # Initialize empty dictionaries for all nodes
    all_nodes = set(node_dict.keys()).union(
        *[set(relatives.keys()) for relatives in node_dict.values()])
    
    for node in all_nodes:
        reverse_dict[node] = {}
    
    # Populate reverse mappings
    for node, relatives in node_dict.items():
        for relative, degree in relatives.items():
            reverse_dict[relative][node] = degree
    
    return reverse_dict</code></pre>
                
                <p>This dual representation allows efficient navigation in both directions through the pedigree, facilitating operations like finding all descendants of an individual or tracing ancestry paths.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Representing Relationships</h4>
                <p>Beyond the node dictionaries, Bonsai v3 uses a compact tuple representation for relationships between individuals: <code>(up, down, num_ancs)</code></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>up:</strong> Number of meioses up from individual 1 to common ancestor</li>
                    <li><strong>down:</strong> Number of meioses down from common ancestor to individual 2</li>
                    <li><strong>num_ancs:</strong> Number of common ancestors (1 for half relationships, 2 for full relationships)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This representation has several advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compact encoding of relationship types</li>
                    <li>Direct mapping to genetic inheritance patterns</li>
                    <li>Clear distinction between full and half relationships</li>
                    <li>Support for arbitrary relationship distances</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Common relationship tuples include:</p>
                <pre><code>"identical/self": (0, 0, 2)
"parent-child": (0, 1, 1)
"child-parent": (1, 0, 1)
"full sibling": (1, 1, 2)
"half sibling": (1, 1, 1)
"grandparent-grandchild": (0, 2, 1)
"aunt/uncle-niece/nephew": (1, 2, 1)
"first cousin": (2, 2, 1)
"second cousin": (3, 3, 1)</code></pre>
                
                <p>The Bonsai codebase includes functions to convert between relationship tuples and relationship names, facilitating user-friendly output:</p>
                
                <pre><code>def get_relationship_name(relationship_tuple):
    """Convert a relationship tuple to a human-readable name.

                <p>This bidirectional mapping between compact tuples and human-readable names is crucial for both internal computation and user interface elements.</p>

                <h4>Finding Relatives and Paths</h4>
                <p>Bonsai v3 includes a suite of functions for navigating and querying pedigrees. These functions build upon the foundation of the node dictionaries to provide higher-level operations.</p>

            <p>The Lab09 notebook provides a simplified exploration of pedigree data structures, while the production implementation in Bonsai v3 includes additional sophistication:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance Optimizations:</strong> The production code includes optimized implementations for large pedigrees</li>
                <li><strong>Caching Mechanisms:</strong> Strategic caching to avoid redundant computation in frequently accessed operations</li>
                <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Comprehensive error checking and validation for robust operation</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Efficiency:</strong> Careful attention to memory usage in large-scale pedigree operations</li>
                <li><strong>Graph Algorithms:</strong> Sophisticated graph-theoretic algorithms for complex pedigree analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Serialization:</strong> Functions for saving and loading pedigrees in various formats</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The notebook provides a valuable introduction to the key concepts, but the production implementation represents years of refinement to handle the complexities of real-world pedigrees, including large family structures, missing data, and complex relationship patterns.</p>

<h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
            <p>As you explore pedigree data structures, consider these broader implications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Structure Design:</strong> How the choice of representation impacts the efficiency and expressiveness of operations</li>
                <li><strong>Graph Theory:</strong> How pedigrees represent a specialized form of directed graph with biological constraints</li>
                <li><strong>Computational Genetics:</strong> The interplay between genetic inheritance patterns and computational representations</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability Challenges:</strong> The technical challenges of representing complex family structures across many generations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These considerations highlight how pedigree data structures represent not just a technical implementation but a computational model of biological inheritance and family relationships, bridging the gap between genetics, genealogy, and computer science.</p>
