    "The following code block is responsible for parsing and processing raw genotype files located within a specified target subdirectory. Its primary objectives are to standardize the genotype data, ensure alignment to the GRCh38 (Build 38) reference genome, determine biological sex based on SNP data, and convert the processed information into TSV files for subsequent VCF conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Directory Setup**\n",
    "  - Creates a subdirectory (`parsed_tsv_files`) within the target directory to store processed TSV files.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Lineage Object Initialization**\n",
    "  - Instantiates a `Lineage` object using the output directory, reference resources, and parallel processing options (10 processes) for efficient data handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File Iteration and User Identification**\n",
    "  - Iterates over all files in the target subdirectory, filtering for files that start with `\"user\"`.\n",
    "  - Aggregates file paths by user identifier to manage cases where a single user may have multiple genotype files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Profile Creation and Data Standardization**\n",
    "  - Creates an individual profile for each user using the `Lineage` object.\n",
    "  - Validates the profile and checks whether it is mapped to Build 38. If not, attempts to remap and logs the outcome.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Sex Determination**\n",
    "  - Determines the sex of each individual based on specific thresholds for heterozygous SNPs on the X chromosome and the presence of Y chromosome SNPs.\n",
    "  - Logs successful sex determinations as well as any failures for further review.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Progress Tracking and Logging**\n",
    "  - Utilizes `tqdm` to display a progress bar during the file processing.\n",
    "  - Maintains comprehensive logging, including error handling for remapping and sex determination issues.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Output Generation**\n",
    "  - Writes consolidated logs to files within the target directory (e.g., general errors, determined sex, and failed sex determinations).\n",
    "  - Returns the directory containing the parsed TSV files, which are used in later steps of the pipeline.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This module is critical for ensuring that raw genotype data is consistently processed and standardized, laying a robust foundation for accurate VCF conversion and further genetic analysis."

    "# What Makes a FASTA File the \"Reference\" Genome for Humans?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **FASTA file** is a widely used text-based format for representing nucleotide (DNA/RNA) or protein sequences. It is structured to contain sequence data along with an identifying **header**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **reference genome** is a **high-quality, curated DNA sequence** that serves as a **standard** for comparing and analyzing other genomes. The **FASTA file** used as the **human reference genome** contains the **consensus sequence of human DNA**, which researchers use as a **baseline** for mapping and identifying genetic variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ What Defines a Reference Genome?\n",
    "A **reference genome** is:\n",
    "✅ **Assembled from multiple human samples** → It does not represent a single individual’s genome but an **aggregate \"best guess\"** of the human genome.  \n",
    "✅ **Organized by chromosomes** → The sequence is **divided into chromosomes** (chr1, chr2, ..., chrX, chrY, chrMT for mitochondria).  \n",
    "✅ **Continuously updated** → It is revised over time as sequencing technology improves.  \n",
    "✅ **Labeled with precise coordinates** → Every base pair position is assigned a fixed **genomic coordinate** (e.g., `chr1:1000000`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Why Is It Called a \"Reference\" Genome?\n",
    "- It provides a **consistent framework** for genetic studies.\n",
    "- Variations (SNPs, insertions, deletions, structural variants) are identified **relative** to this reference.\n",
    "- It is **not representative of all human diversity**, but it serves as a standardized **comparison point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Sources of the Human Reference Genome\n",
    "The most widely used human reference genomes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Version** | **Source** | **Features** |\n",
    "|-------------|-----------|--------------|\n",
    "| **GRCh38/hg38** | Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) | The most up-to-date, widely used reference genome. |\n",
    "| **GRCh37/hg19** | UCSC Genome Browser, Ensembl | Older but still used for compatibility with legacy datasets. |\n",
    "| **T2T-CHM13** | Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium | A complete reference with full centromeres and telomeres. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ How Is a Reference Genome Stored in a FASTA File?\n",
    "A **reference genome FASTA file** contains:\n",
    "1. **Chromosome names** (headers starting with `>chrN`).\n",
    "2. **DNA sequences** (A, T, G, C, and N for unknown regions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example (GRCh38 reference FASTA snippet):\n",
    "```\n",
    "chr1 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN AGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAG TTCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGAT chr2 AGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAG NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Why the \"N\" Bases?**  \n",
    "- `N` means \"unknown base\" due to **low sequencing coverage** or **complex repetitive regions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ How the Reference Genome Is Used\n",
    "🔬 **Mapping Reads:** Aligning sequencing data (FASTQ) to the reference to identify variations.  \n",
    "🧬 **Variant Calling:** Identifying SNPs, insertions, deletions, and structural variants.  \n",
    "📍 **Genome Annotation:** Identifying genes, exons, and regulatory elements.  \n",
    "🧪 **Disease Research:** Comparing patient genomes to the reference to find disease-associated mutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example command to **align sequencing data to a reference genome**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "bwa mem Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.allchromosomes.fa sample_reads.fastq > aligned.sam\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features of FASTA Files**\n",
    "- **Simple format:** Readable by humans and bioinformatics tools.\n",
    "- **Supports large datasets:** Used for entire genomes and protein databases.\n",
    "- **Compatible with major bioinformatics tools:** Used in `samtools`, `bcftools`, `BLAST`, and sequence alignment programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Uses of FASTA Files**\n",
    "✅ **Reference Genomes:** FASTA files are used as reference sequences in **genome alignment** and **variant calling**.  \n",
    "✅ **BLAST Searches:** Querying DNA or protein databases for sequence similarity.  \n",
    "✅ **Multiple Sequence Alignments:** Used in phylogenetics and evolutionary analysis.  \n",
    "✅ **Genome Annotation:** Identifying genes and functional elements in DNA sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Work with FASTA Files**\n",
    "- **View a FASTA file**:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    head -n 20 genome.fa\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Extract a specific chromosome**:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    samtools faidx genome.fa chr1:100000-200000\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    grep -A 2 \"AGCTAGCTAGCT\" genome.fa\n",

    "## **Final Interpretation: What These Numbers Mean**\n",

    "   - High **Missing GTs** → Potential **poor-quality genotype calls**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Variant composition**:\n",
    "   - High **Hom RR** → Many SNPs match the reference genome.\n",
    "   - High **Het RA** → More **genetic diversity** in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Potential issues in reference genome compatibility**:\n",
    "   - If **Rows Skipped is high**, verify that the **TSV file matches the reference genome** used in `bcftools`.\n",
    "   - If the **Het RA to Hom AA ratio** is significantly skewed, consider whether the dataset contains **multi-allelic sites**.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Example Summary**\n",
    "Here’s how a typical conversion result looks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rows total:** `701039` → **Total SNP sites in the TSV file**  \n",
    "- **Rows skipped:** `1` → **Only 1 site was skipped (good quality data)**  \n",
    "- **Sites written:** `701038` → **Nearly all SNPs were successfully written to VCF**  \n",
    "- **Missing GTs:** `16262` → **16,262 sites have missing genotype data**  \n",
    "- **Hom RR:** `350727` → **Half of the sites match the reference genome**  \n",
    "- **Het RA:** `202225` → **202,225 heterozygous sites (one ref, one alt allele)**  \n",
    "- **Hom AA:** `131708` → **131,708 sites where both alleles are alternative**  \n",
    "- **Het AA:** `116` → **Very rare cases where two alternative alleles are present**  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Potential Errors and Warnings**\n",
    "- **Too many rows skipped?**  \n",
    "  - Double-check the **TSV file format** and **reference genome compatibility**.  \n",
    "  - Ensure that chromosomes are properly labeled (`1-22, X, Y`).  \n",
    "  - If using a liftover tool, verify that the conversion was **successful**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Too many missing genotypes (`--`)?**  \n",
    "  - This could indicate **poor-quality sequencing or genotyping**.  \n",
    "  - If filtering, consider setting a **minimum call rate threshold**.  \n",
