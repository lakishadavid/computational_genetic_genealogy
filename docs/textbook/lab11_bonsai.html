            <h2>Lab 12: Reconstructing Pedigrees with Bonsai</h2>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Pedigree reconstruction represents the culmination of genetic genealogy—transforming raw biological patterns into meaningful family connections. By inferring ancestral relationships from genetic data alone, we can rebuild lost histories, reconnect fragmented lineages, and provide a powerful tool for understanding how historical events have shaped human kinship across generations.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
            
            <h4>The Genealogical Inference Challenge</h4>
            <p>At its heart, pedigree reconstruction addresses one of the most fundamental human questions: How are we related to each other? Throughout history, humans have created elaborate kinship systems, maintained oral traditions, and documented family connections through written records. However, these cultural systems are vulnerable to disruption through migration, colonization, enslavement, adoption, and social upheaval.</p>
            
            <p>Computational pedigree reconstruction offers a biological complement to these cultural methods, allowing us to recover relationships even when documentary evidence is missing or incomplete. This process transforms IBD segments—the biological remnants of shared ancestry—into reconstructed family trees that provide a scientific account of relatedness.</p>
            
            <p>The central challenge lies in translating a complex pattern of genetic sharing between multiple individuals into a coherent family structure that logically explains these patterns. This requires addressing questions such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are two people who share DNA related through a recent common ancestor or multiple distant paths?</li>
                <li>What minimal pedigree structure explains all observed genetic connections in a group?</li>
                <li>How can we distinguish between different possible relationship configurations that produce similar genetic sharing?</li>
                <li>How do we account for missing individuals who connect the sampled people but aren't present in our dataset?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Bonsai Approach</h4>
            <p>The BonsaiTree algorithm, like its botanical namesake, approaches pedigree reconstruction through careful, iterative shaping of possibilities. Just as bonsai cultivation reveals the essential structure of a tree through selective pruning, the algorithm gradually constrains the space of possible relationships to reveal the underlying pedigree structure.</p>
            
            <p>This process integrates three key elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statistical Modeling</strong>: Using probability distributions to predict expected patterns of IBD sharing under different relationship scenarios</li>
                <li><strong>Graph Theory</strong>: Representing potential family structures as networks where individuals are nodes and relationships are edges</li>
                <li><strong>Biological Constraints</strong>: Enforcing rules that reflect biological reality, such as generational timing, reproductive limitations, and genetic inheritance patterns</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>By combining these approaches, Bonsai can infer complex multi-generational structures that would be difficult or impossible to discern through pairwise relationship analyses alone.</p>

            <h3>Theoretical Foundations</h3>
            
            <h4>The Mathematics of Pedigree Inference</h4>
            <p>Pedigree reconstruction is fundamentally a probabilistic inference problem. For any observed pattern of IBD sharing, multiple pedigree structures could potentially explain it. The goal is to find the most likely structure, given the data.</p>
            
            <p>This leads to a mathematical formulation:</p>
            <p><em>P(pedigree | observed IBD) ∝ P(observed IBD | pedigree) × P(pedigree)</em></p>
            
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>P(pedigree | observed IBD)</em> is the probability of a particular pedigree structure given the observed IBD segments</li>
                <li><em>P(observed IBD | pedigree)</em> is the likelihood of observing the specific IBD patterns if the pedigree were true</li>
                <li><em>P(pedigree)</em> is the prior probability of the pedigree structure before considering genetic data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This Bayesian framework allows the algorithm to incorporate both genetic evidence and prior knowledge (like known birth years, historical constraints, or documented relationships) when available.</p>

            <h4>Graph Theoretic Representation</h4>
            <p>Pedigrees are naturally represented as directed acyclic graphs, where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each individual is a node in the graph</li>
                <li>Parent-child relationships are directed edges</li>
                <li>The direction of edges follows the flow of genetic material through generations</li>
                <li>No cycles can exist (a person cannot be their own ancestor)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This representation allows algorithms to leverage powerful graph theory concepts to construct and evaluate potential pedigree structures. When inferring missing ancestors, the algorithm must optimize the graph structure to balance competing objectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimizing the number of added latent individuals (parsimony)</li>
                <li>Maximizing the explanation of observed genetic sharing (completeness)</li>
                <li>Maintaining biological plausibility (consistency)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The result is a reconstructed family tree that best explains the observed genetic connections while following biological constraints.</p>

            <h3>Applications and Implications</h3>
            
            <h4>Recovering Lost Histories</h4>
            <p>Pedigree reconstruction has profound implications for communities whose family histories have been disrupted by historical trauma. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Post-Slavery Reconnection</strong>: Descendants of enslaved people often lack documentary evidence of family connections due to deliberate erasure of kinship during slavery. Genetic pedigree reconstruction can help rebuild these connections beyond the limited historical record.</li>
                <li><strong>Indigenous Kinship Restoration</strong>: Indigenous communities affected by forced removal policies, residential/boarding schools, and adoption programs can use pedigree reconstruction to reestablish connections disrupted by colonization.</li>
                <li><strong>Diaspora Reunification</strong>: Communities scattered by war, genocide, or forced migration can reconnect family branches separated by these historical events.</li>
                <li><strong>Adoption Reunification</strong>: Individuals seeking biological family connections after closed adoptions can identify not just direct relatives but broader family structures.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In these contexts, computational pedigree reconstruction becomes not just a scientific tool but a means of historical and cultural reclamation.</p>

            <h4>Integrating Cultural and Biological Kinship</h4>
            <p>Anthropologists recognize that kinship operates at both biological and cultural levels, often with complex interrelationships between the two. Pedigree reconstruction creates opportunities to study these relationships by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Comparing inferred biological relationships to culturally recognized kinship structures</li>
                <li>Exploring how social kinship practices (like adoption, fictive kinship, or marriage patterns) interact with genetic inheritance</li>
                <li>Examining how different societies reconcile biological and social definitions of relatedness</li>
                <li>Understanding how genetic kinship might be interpreted differently across cultural contexts</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This integration of biological and cultural perspectives enriches both genetic genealogy and anthropological approaches to kinship.</p>

            <h3>Limitations and Challenges</h3>
            
            <h4>The Limits of Genetic Evidence</h4>
            <p>While powerful, pedigree reconstruction faces several inherent limitations:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Temporal Depth</strong>: The recombination process that creates IBD segments also fragments them over generations. Beyond approximately 5-7 generations, IBD segments become too small or too few to reliably reconstruct relationships. This creates a genetic horizon beyond which pedigree reconstruction becomes increasingly uncertain.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Structural Ambiguity</strong>: Different pedigree configurations can produce statistically indistinguishable patterns of genetic sharing. For example, the genetic sharing between half-siblings can be difficult to distinguish from that between an aunt/uncle and niece/nephew without additional relatives to provide context.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Missing Data</strong>: Pedigree reconstruction works best when most members of recent generations are sampled. When key connecting individuals are missing from the dataset, the algorithm must infer latent (unobserved) ancestors, introducing additional uncertainty.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Complex Mating Patterns</strong>: Most pedigree reconstruction algorithms assume random mating. In populations with endogamy (marriage within a community), consanguinity (marriage between relatives), or other non-random mating patterns, standard models may produce inaccurate results.</p>

            <h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>
            <p>The ability to infer family relationships from genetic data raises important ethical questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Privacy Implications</strong>: Pedigree reconstruction can reveal relationships that individuals may not be aware of or wish to keep private, such as unknown parentage or previously undisclosed adoptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Consent Boundaries</strong>: An individual's genetic data can reveal information about relatives who have not consented to testing or research participation.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Sensitivity</strong>: Different cultures have varying norms about kinship disclosure, adoption, and family structure that may not align with biological reconstruction approaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Impact</strong>: Revealing biological relationships can affect inheritance rights, tribal membership, legal status, and family dynamics in complex ways.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These considerations necessitate careful, culturally informed approaches to pedigree reconstruction, especially in sensitive contexts.</p>

            <h3>Broader Context</h3>
            
            <h4>Historical Demography</h4>
            <p>Beyond individual family histories, reconstructed pedigrees provide valuable data for understanding historical population dynamics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inferring historical fertility patterns and family structures</li>
                <li>Detecting demographic events like population bottlenecks or expansions</li>
                <li>Analyzing marriage patterns and social structures across generations</li>
                <li>Studying how migration and admixture have shaped community genetics</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These applications extend the value of pedigree reconstruction beyond personal genealogy to broader historical and anthropological questions.</p>

            <h4>Future Directions</h4>
            <p>The field of computational pedigree reconstruction continues to evolve, with several promising directions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integration with Documentary Evidence</strong>: Combining genetic pedigree reconstruction with historical records, oral histories, and other non-genetic evidence</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Context Adaptation</strong>: Developing algorithms that can account for diverse marriage patterns, kinship systems, and cultural practices</li>
                <li><strong>Ancient DNA Application</strong>: Extending techniques to work with ancient DNA to connect modern populations with historical communities</li>
                <li><strong>Community-Centered Approaches</strong>: Creating tools that empower communities to reconstruct their own genetic histories according to their cultural values and needs</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These developments point toward increasingly sophisticated, culturally informed approaches to pedigree reconstruction that honor both biological realities and diverse human kinship systems.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-success">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When working with pedigree reconstruction, remember that the results represent probabilities rather than certainties. Always interpret inferred relationships with appropriate caution, especially when making claims about specific family connections that may have personal significance to living individuals.</p>
