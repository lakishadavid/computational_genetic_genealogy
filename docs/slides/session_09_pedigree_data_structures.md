# Session 9: Pedigree Data Structures Implementation

## Session Overview
This session examines the core data structures used to represent and manipulate pedigrees in Bonsai v3, focusing on implementation details and algorithmic considerations.

## Key Topics

### 1. Pedigree Representation Requirements
- Goals for an effective pedigree data structure:
  - Memory efficiency for large pedigrees
  - Fast traversal and relationship queries
  - Support for both observed and inferred individuals
  - Extensibility for additional attributes
  - Compatibility with visualization tools
- Tradeoffs in different representation approaches

### 2. The Up-Node Dictionary Implementation
- Detailed structure and organization:
  ```python
  up_node_dict = {
      1000: {1001: 1, 1002: 1},  # Individual 1000 has parents 1001 and 1002
      1003: {1001: 1, 1002: 1},  # Individual 1003 has same parents (siblings)
      1004: {-1: 1, -2: 1},      # Individual 1004 has inferred parents
      -1: {1005: 1, 1006: 1},    # Inferred individual -1 has parents 1005, 1006
      # ... additional relationships
  }
  ```
- Algorithmic properties and complexity analysis
- Memory footprint and optimization techniques
- Handling of missing data and incomplete relationships

### 3. Pedigree Tracking Structures
- Implementation of key tracking dictionaries:
  - `idx_to_up_dict_ll_list`: Maps indices to (pedigree, likelihood) pairs
  - `id_to_idx`: Maps individual IDs to pedigree indices
  - `idx_to_id_set`: Maps pedigree indices to individual sets
- Maintenance during pedigree construction and modification
- Consistency guarantees and invariants

### 4. Pedigree Operations and Algorithms
- Traversal algorithms for up-node dictionaries
- Relationship determination between individuals
- Cycle detection and prevention
- Merging and splitting operations

### 5. Observed vs. Inferred Individuals
- ID convention for inferred individuals (negative IDs)
- Creating and managing inferred ancestors
- Constraints on inferred individual positions
- Handling evidence for previously inferred individuals

### 6. Functions for Pedigree Manipulation
- `get_up_dict_with_trio()`: Creating basic family units
- `copy_up_dict()`: Deep copying pedigree structures
- `get_descendants()`: Finding all descendants of an individual
- `get_ancestors()`: Finding all ancestors of an individual
- `are_related()`: Determining if two individuals are related

### 7. Time and Space Complexity Analysis
- Computational complexity of key operations
- Memory consumption analysis
- Scaling behavior with pedigree size
- Bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

### 8. Validation and Consistency Checking
- Methods for pedigree validation:
  - Testing for biological consistency (sex, age)
  - Checking for cycles or impossible structures
  - Ensuring completeness of reference tracking
- Error handling and recovery strategies

## Practical Components
- Implementing core pedigree operations
- Building and manipulating sample pedigrees
- Performance analysis of different operations
- Debugging common issues in pedigree structures
