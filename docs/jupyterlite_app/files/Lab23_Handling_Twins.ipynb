    "\n",
    "### Theory and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Twins present a unique challenge in genetic genealogy for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identical Twins (Monozygotic)**: Share virtually 100% of their DNA because they develop from a single fertilized egg that splits into two embryos. They are always the same sex and typically share very similar physical characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fraternal Twins (Dizygotic)**: Develop from two separate fertilized eggs and share approximately 50% of their DNA, similar to non-twin siblings. They can be the same or different sexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Genetic Ambiguity**: The extremely high DNA sharing in identical twins can be difficult to distinguish from parent-child relationships, which also show very high sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pedigree Placement**: When constructing a family tree, twins require special handling to ensure they are both placed as children of the same parents with the correct relationships to other relatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twin detection in genetic genealogy relies on a combination of genetic and non-genetic information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Genetic Criteria**: The proportion of DNA shared between individuals\n",
    "- **Demographic Criteria**: Age, sex, and other personal information\n",
    "- **Statistical Thresholds**: Cutoff values that distinguish twins from other close relatives\n",

    "### Analysis of Twin Detection Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our exploration of the `is_twin_pair` function and our implementation of the test cases, we can summarize Bonsai's twin detection criteria as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **IBD Sharing Threshold**: Both individuals must share at least 95% of their autosomal genome (approximately 3367.75 cM) in both half-IBD and full-IBD segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sex Concordance**: Both individuals must have the same sex. This makes sense for identical twins, who are always the same sex, but means that fraternal twins of different sexes won't be classified as twins in Bonsai.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Age Matching**: If the ages of both individuals are known, they must be identical. This reflects the biological reality that twins are born on the same day.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Missing Data Handling**: \n",
    "   - If IBD data is missing, the individuals won't be classified as twins.\n",
    "   - If age data is missing for one or both individuals, the age criterion is effectively skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "These strict criteria ensure that only individuals with very high genetic similarity and matching sex and age are classified as twins. However, there are some potential limitations to this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identical twins with slightly different recorded ages (due to data errors or different registration dates) would be missed.\n",
    "- Fraternal twins of different sexes won't be classified as twins despite having the same parents and birth date.\n",
    "- The high IBD threshold might miss some fraternal twins who share less than 95% of their genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we'll explore how Bonsai groups twins into sets and integrates them into pedigree structures."

   "source": "## Part 2: Building Twin Sets\n\n### Theory and Background\n\nWhen multiple twins are present in a dataset, Bonsai needs to organize them into **twin sets** - groups of individuals who are all twins with each other. This organization is important for several reasons:\n\n1. **Transitive Relationships**: If person A is a twin of person B, and person B is a twin of person C, then A and C must also be twins. Twin sets enforce this transitive property.\n\n2. **Consistent Pedigree Integration**: All members of a twin set should have identical relationships with other individuals in the pedigree. For example, if one twin has a parent identified, all twins in the set should have that same parent.\n\n3. **Computational Efficiency**: By grouping twins together, algorithms can treat the entire set as a unit in many operations, reducing redundancy.\n\nThe process of building twin sets involves:\n\n1. Identifying all pairwise twin relationships using the criteria we examined in Part 1\n2. Grouping these pairs into coherent sets based on shared membership\n3. Ensuring that all members of a set share the same demographic attributes (sex, age)\n4. Maintaining a mapping between individual IDs and their twin set memberships\n\nIn genetic genealogy algorithms, twin sets are often used to simplify relationship inference and pedigree construction by reducing the number of entities that need to be positioned independently in the family tree.",

   "source": "## Part 3: Twin Integration in Pedigree Construction\n\n### Theory and Background\n\nOnce twin sets have been identified, they need to be properly integrated into pedigree structures. This integration presents several challenges:\n\n1. **Relationship Consistency**: All members of a twin set must have identical relationships with other individuals in the pedigree. If twin A is a parent of person C, then twin B must also be a parent of person C.\n\n2. **Disambiguation**: In some cases, the high genetic similarity between twins makes it difficult to determine unique relationships. For example, if A and B are twins, and C is genetically determined to be a child of one of them, it may be impossible to determine whether C is a child of A or B based on genetics alone.\n\n3. **Efficiency in Representation**: Pedigree data structures should efficiently handle twins without duplicating relationship information.\n\nIn Bonsai v3, the twin handling in pedigree construction follows these general principles:\n\n1. Twin sets are identified early in the pedigree construction process\n2. Twins are treated as a unit for relationship inference\n3. When relationships are assigned to one member of a twin set, they are automatically propagated to all members of the set\n4. Visualization and reporting mechanisms indicate twin relationships\n\nLet's examine how this works in practice for different relationship scenarios.",

Some practical strategies include:\n\n- Combining genetic data with non-genetic information (age, sex, birth dates, etc.)\n- Explicitly asking users to indicate known twin relationships\n- Using advanced statistical methods to distinguish between relationship types with similar genetic sharing patterns\n- Implementing special handling for twin sets in pedigree visualization and relationship reporting\n\nIn Bonsai v3, the twin detection and handling mechanisms we've explored provide a solid foundation for addressing these real-world needs.",

   "source": "## Summary\n\nIn this lab, we explored how Bonsai v3 handles identical twins and other extremely close genetic relatives through its specialized `twins.py` module. Key takeaways include:\n\n1. Twin detection in Bonsai relies on both genetic criteria (high IBD sharing above the TWIN_THRESHOLD of 95% of the genome) and non-genetic criteria (matching sex and age).\n\n2. Bonsai organizes twins into coherent sets that maintain the transitive property of twin relationships, ensuring that if A and B are twins, and B and C are twins, then A and C are also treated as twins.\n\n3. In pedigree construction, twin sets are treated as units with identical relationships to other individuals, which simplifies relationship inference and ensures consistency.\n\n4. Visualizing pedigrees with twins requires special consideration to clearly indicate twin relationships and maintain the correct family structure.\n\n5. Real-world applications of twin detection algorithms face challenges like distinguishing identical twins from parent-child pairs and handling fraternal twins of different sexes.\n\n### Connections to Other Labs\n\nThe concepts covered in this lab connect to:\n- **Lab 9: Pedigree Data Structures** - Twin sets are integrated into pedigree structures\n- **Lab 12: Relationship Assessment** - Twin relationships affect how other relationships are inferred\n- **Lab 16: Merging Pedigrees** - Twin detection is important when combining pedigree fragments\n\n### Further Reading\n\nTo deepen your understanding of these topics, consider exploring:\n\n- Visscher, P.

The function should implement the twin detection criteria as defined in Bonsai's `is_twin_pair` function:\n\n```python\ndef check_twin_status(total_half_ibd, total_full_ibd, age1, age2, sex1, sex2):\n    TWIN_THRESHOLD = 0.95 * 3545\n    \n    # Check for None values in IBD sharing\n    if total_half_ibd is None or total_full_ibd is None:\n        return False, \"Missing IBD data\"\n    \n    # Check IBD thresholds\n    if total_half_ibd < TWIN_THRESHOLD:\n        return False, f\"Half-IBD sharing ({total_half_ibd:.2f} cM) below threshold ({TWIN_THRESHOLD:.2f} cM)\"\n    \n    if total_full_ibd < TWIN_THRESHOLD:\n        return False, f\"Full-IBD sharing ({total_full_ibd:.2f} cM) below threshold ({TWIN_THRESHOLD:.2f} cM)\"\n    \n    # Check sex matching\n    if sex1 != sex2:\n        return False, f\"Sex mismatch: {sex1} vs {sex2} (must match for twins)\"\n    \n    # Check age matching (only if both ages are known)\n    if age1 is not None and age2 is not None and age1 != age2:\n        return False, f\"Age mismatch: {age1} vs {age2} (must match for twins)\"\n    \n    # If all criteria pass, classify as twins\n    return True, \"Meets all twin criteria: high IBD sharing, matching sex and age\"\n```\n\n### Exercise 2\nThe solution is provided in the notebook. The `build_twin_sets` function should handle all cases of adding twins to sets and merging sets when necessary:\n\n```python\ndef build_twin_sets(twin_pairs):\n    list_of_twin_sets = []\n    \n    for id1, id2 in twin_pairs:\n        set1 = None\n        set2 = None\n        \n        for twin_set in list_of_twin_sets:\n            if id1 in twin_set:\n                set1 = twin_set\n            if id2 in twin_set:\n                set2 = twin_set\n        \n        if set1 is None and set2 is None:\n            list_of_twin_sets.append({id1, id2})\n        elif set1 is not None and set2 is None:\n            set1.add(id2)\n        elif set1 is None and set2 is not None:\n            set2.add(id1)\n        elif set1 is not set2:\n            set1.update(set2)\n            list_of_twin_sets.remove(set2)\n    \n    return list_of_twin_sets\n```\n\n### Exercise 3\nThe solution is provided in the notebook. The `visualize_pedigree_with_twins` function should:\n1. Create a directed graph representation of the pedigree\n2. Assign colors to twin sets for visual distinction\n3. Visualize the pedigree with appropriate styling and a legend\n\n### Self-Assessment Answers\n\n1. The TWIN_THRESHOLD value in Bonsai v3 is 0.95 * GENOME_LENGTH, which equals approximately 3367.75 cM. This represents the minimum amount of genetic sharing (in centiMorgans) required for two individuals to be classified as twins. It's set at 95% of the autosomal genome length.\n\n2. Bonsai checks both half-IBD and full-IBD sharing because both types of sharing must exceed the threshold for twin detection. This ensures that the genetic similarity is high across the entire genome, not just in certain segments, which helps distinguish twins from other close relatives.\n\n3. Fraternal twins of different sexes pose a challenge because Bonsai's twin detection algorithm requires matching sex for twin classification. This means that fraternal twins of different sexes (which is biologically common) will not be classified as twins in the system, despite being born at the same time to the same parents.\n\n4. The `get_twin_sets` function handles the transitive property by merging twin sets when it finds an individual who belongs to more than one set. When two individuals from different twin sets are identified as twins, the function combines their respective sets and updates all mapping information to maintain consistency.\n\n5. Two key benefits of organizing twins into sets during pedigree construction are:\n   - Relationship consistency: All twins in a set have identical relationships with other individuals in the pedigree\n   - Computational efficiency: The algorithm can treat the entire set as a unit, reducing redundancy and simplifying the inference process",
