            <h2>Lab 7: Simulating Genetic Inheritance with Ped-Sim</h2>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p><strong>Conceptual Foundations:</strong> This lab explores how genetic material flows through family trees across generations. Understanding this transmission process is crucial for interpreting genetic relationships and reconstructing genealogical connections from DNA data.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Generational Flow of Genetic Material</h4>
                <p>The fundamental process of genetic inheritance involves several key mechanisms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DNA Transmission:</strong> Each parent passes approximately 50% of their autosomal DNA to each child</li>
                    <li><strong>Recombination:</strong> During gamete formation, the parental chromosomes exchange segments, creating unique combinations in each child</li>
                    <li><strong>Random Assortment:</strong> The specific portions of DNA inherited from each grandparent are randomly determined</li>
                    <li><strong>Dilution Across Generations:</strong> The percentage of DNA from a specific ancestor decreases by approximately half each generation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Ped-Sim software you'll use in this lab mathematically models these biological processes, allowing you to visualize and analyze exactly how DNA segments flow through a family tree over multiple generations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Simulation as a Bridge Between Theory and Reality</h4>
                <p>Genetic simulation serves a crucial role in genetic genealogy for several reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ground Truth Creation:</strong> Simulations provide known relationships and IBD segments that serve as a "gold standard" to evaluate detection methods</li>
                    <li><strong>Counterfactual Exploration:</strong> Simulations allow exploration of hypothetical scenarios (e.g., "What if this historical migration pattern had been different?")</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex Pattern Generation:</strong> Some relationship patterns (e.g., endogamy, multiple half-relationships) are difficult to find in real data but easy to simulate</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> Simulated data allows method development without privacy concerns associated with real genetic data</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you create simulated data in this lab, you're generating a controlled environment where you can directly observe genetic inheritance patterns that would be impossible to track precisely in real human populations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Forward vs. Backward Genetic Simulation</h4>
                <p>Different genetic simulation approaches model inheritance from different temporal perspectives:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Forward Simulation (Ped-Sim):</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Starts with founder individuals and follows genetic transmission through specified family relationships</li>
                            <li>Directly mimics the biological process of meiosis and recombination</li>
                            <li>Particularly useful for recent genealogical relationships (7-10 generations)</li>
                            <li>Computationally efficient for modeling specific pedigree structures</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Backward/Coalescent Simulation (MSPrime):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Starts with present-day individuals and traces their genetic lineages backward in time</li>
                            <li>More computationally efficient for modeling population-level processes</li>
                            <li>Better suited for deeper time scales and demographic modeling</li>
                            <li>Less intuitive for visualizing recent family relationships</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The forward simulation approach used by Ped-Sim aligns particularly well with genealogical applications because it directly models the actual process of genetic inheritance through known pedigree structures.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Mathematical and Computational Frameworks</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Mathematics of Genetic Recombination</h4>
                <p>Recombination—the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes during meiosis—is the key process that creates unique genetic combinations in each generation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Poisson Process:</strong> Recombination events are typically modeled as a Poisson process along the chromosome</li>
                    <li><strong>Genetic Distance:</strong> Measured in centimorgans (cM), where 1 cM represents approximately a 1% chance of recombination</li>
                    <li><strong>Position-Dependent Rates:</strong> Recombination rates vary across the genome (hotspots and coldspots)</li>
                    <li><strong>Interference:</strong> One recombination event reduces the probability of another nearby event</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ped-Sim implements these mathematical models to realistically simulate how recombination creates the mosaic pattern of ancestral DNA segments in each individual's genome. When you run the simulation, the underlying code is executing these mathematical processes to determine precisely which segments of DNA are transmitted from parents to children.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Modeling Family Structures Computationally</h4>
                <p>Family relationships form a directed graph structure (a pedigree) that guides the flow of genetic material:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Directed Acyclic Graphs:</strong> Pedigrees are mathematically represented as directed acyclic graphs</li>
                    <li><strong>Topological Ordering:</strong> Simulations must process individuals in a topological order (parents before children)</li>
                    <li><strong>State Vectors:</strong> Each individual's genome is represented as a vector of ancestry states along chromosomes</li>
                    <li><strong>Transition Matrices:</strong> Recombination is modeled using state transition matrices between adjacent positions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The pedigree definition file you'll create in this lab provides the structural framework that determines how genetic material flows from founders to descendants. The attention to detail in this structure—correctly specifying parents, children, and their relationships—is crucial for accurate simulation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Generating Realistic Founder Haplotypes</h4>
                <p>To create realistic simulated data, the starting genetic material for founder individuals must reflect actual human genetic diversity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reference Panels:</strong> Real human genetic data (like 1000 Genomes) provides realistic starting haplotypes</li>
                    <li><strong>Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):</strong> The correlation structure between nearby variants must be preserved</li>
                    <li><strong>Population Structure:</strong> Founder haplotypes should reflect appropriate population genetic characteristics</li>
                    <li><strong>Variant Density:</strong> The density and distribution of genetic variants affects detectability of relationships</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When the simulation procedure selects and assigns founder haplotypes, it's establishing the genetic baseline from which all subsequent inheritance patterns will develop. This foundation determines the realism and applicability of the simulated data to real-world genetic genealogy scenarios.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Applications to Genetic Genealogy</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Validating IBD Detection Methods</h4>
                <p>A primary application of genetic simulation is to validate the accuracy of IBD detection algorithms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Known Ground Truth:</strong> Simulations provide exact knowledge of true IBD segments</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> Sensitivity (what percentage of true segments are detected) and specificity (what percentage of detected segments are true)</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Patterns:</strong> Systematic evaluation of where and why IBD detection methods fail</li>
                    <li><strong>Parameter Optimization:</strong> Tuning algorithm parameters to maximize accuracy for specific relationship types</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The comparison between true IBD segments (known from the simulation) and detected IBD segments (from algorithms like IBIS) provides crucial information about which genealogical relationships are likely to be accurately detected in real-world data.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Exploring Relationship Detection Limits</h4>
                <p>Simulation helps establish theoretical and practical limits of relationship detection:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Distance Thresholds:</strong> At what genealogical distance do relationships become undetectable?</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Requirements:</strong> How does SNP density affect the ability to detect distant relationships?</li>
                    <li><strong>Algorithm Comparison:</strong> Which IBD detection methods perform best for specific relationship types?</li>
                    <li><strong>Confidence Metrics:</strong> How certain can we be about detected relationships of different types?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By systematically varying relationship configurations in simulated pedigrees, you can establish expected patterns of IBD sharing for different types of relationships, creating a reference framework for interpreting real genetic data.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Modeling Complex Family Structures</h4>
                <p>Simulation is particularly valuable for understanding genetic patterns in complex family structures:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Endogamy:</strong> Marriage within small communities over multiple generations</li>
                    <li><strong>Cousin Marriages:</strong> The genetic effects of marriages between related individuals</li>
                    <li><strong>Half-Relationships:</strong> Patterns of IBD sharing in half-siblings, half-cousins, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple Ancestral Paths:</strong> Situations where two individuals are related through multiple lines of descent</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These complex structures are often encountered in real-world genetic genealogy, particularly in historically isolated communities or cultural contexts where cousin marriage was common. Simulation provides a controlled way to understand the distinctive genetic signatures of these complex relationships.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Anthropological and Historical Contexts</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Modeling Historical Displacement and Reconnection</h4>
                <p>In the context of this course's focus on African diaspora connections, simulation offers powerful tools for understanding genetic patterns resulting from historical displacement:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Family Separation Models:</strong> Simulating the genetic consequences of families separated during the transatlantic slave trade</li>
                    <li><strong>Reconnection Signatures:</strong> The expected patterns of genetic sharing between descendants of separated family members</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Calibration:</strong> Using IBD segment lengths to date ancestral connections to specific historical periods</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Structure:</strong> Modeling how genetic relationships cluster within historically displaced communities</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By simulating specific historical scenarios of family separation and subsequent generational inheritance, you can develop frameworks for interpreting genetic connections that bridge the historical disruption of family records during the transatlantic slave trade.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Cultural Practices and Genetic Patterns</h4>
                <p>Different cultural marriage and family formation practices leave distinctive signatures in genetic data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Polygyny:</strong> The practice of men having multiple wives creates distinctive patterns of half-sibling relationships</li>
                    <li><strong>Preferential Cousin Marriage:</strong> Cultural preferences for certain types of cousin marriages create specific endogamy patterns</li>
                    <li><strong>Matrilineal/Patrilineal Descent:</strong> Different inheritance and residence patterns affect how families cluster geographically</li>
                    <li><strong>Naming Practices:</strong> Correlations between naming traditions and genetic relationships</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Simulation allows anthropologists to develop models that connect specific cultural practices to expected genetic relationship patterns, creating a bridge between cultural anthropology and genetic analysis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Ethical Dimensions of Simulation</h4>
                <p>Genetic simulation also addresses important ethical considerations in genetic genealogy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> Method development using simulated data avoids potential privacy issues with real genetic data</li>
                    <li><strong>Unexpected Relationship Discovery:</strong> Simulating various scenarios helps prepare for sensitive relationship discoveries</li>
                    <li><strong>Interpretation Frameworks:</strong> Developing culturally appropriate frameworks for interpreting genetic relationships</li>
                    <li><strong>Methodological Transparency:</strong> Clear documentation of simulation parameters supports reproducible research</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By using simulation to develop and validate methods before applying them to real community data, researchers can ensure that their approaches are technically sound and ethically responsible, particularly when working with communities with complex histories of displacement and reconnection.</p>

            <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
            <p>As you work through the Ped-Sim simulation exercises, consider these broader implications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Theoretical/Practical Gap:</strong> How do idealized simulations differ from messy real-world genetic data?</li>
                <li><strong>Historical Insight:</strong> How can simulated genetic patterns help recover historical relationships lost to the documentary record?</li>
                <li><strong>Inference Limitations:</strong> What types of relationships remain challenging to detect even in ideal simulated conditions?</li>
                <li><strong>Interpretation Frameworks:</strong> How should detected genetic relationships be contextualized within cultural and historical frameworks?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These considerations connect the technical processes of genetic simulation to the broader anthropological questions about how genetic relationships inform our understanding of family, community, and history across generations and geographic displacements.</p>
