## Clone the Repository

Now that you have set up your coding environment with Visual Studio Code (VSCode), Git, and the recommended extensions, you are ready to clone the codebase and start working on the project. Cloning the repository will create a local copy of the code from the GitHub repository, allowing you to explore, modify, and contribute to the project. By cloning https://github.com/lakishadavid/computational_genetic_genealogy, youâ€™ll have access to all the project files and be able to manage them directly from your local environment, using Git and VSCode's built-in tools to streamline your workflow.

You have two options for cloning the repository and using the code within VSCode.

### Option 1: Cloning the Repository Using VSCode

Follow these steps to clone the repository using Visual Studio Code:

1. **Open VSCode**:
   - Launch Visual Studio Code on your system.

2. **Access the Command Palette**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) to open the Command Palette.

3. **Search for "Clone Repository"**:
   - Type `Git: Clone` in the search bar and select the `Git: Clone` option from the dropdown.

4. **Enter the Repository URL**:
   - When prompted, paste the repository URL:
     ```
     https://github.com/lakishadavid/computational_genetic_genealogy.git
     ```

5. **Choose a Destination Folder**:
   - Select a folder on your local system where you want to clone the repository. VSCode will create a new folder for the project within the selected directory.

6. **Open the Cloned Repository**:
   - Once the cloning process is complete, VSCode will prompt you to open the cloned repository. Click **Open** to start working on the project.

     ```bash
     cd /path/to/your/desired/folder
     ```

3. **Run the Git Clone Command**:
   - Clone the repository by running:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/lakishadavid/computational_genetic_genealogy.git
     ```

4. **Navigate into the Cloned Repository**:
   - Move into the project folder:
     ```bash
     cd computational_genetic_genealogy
     ```

5. **Open the Project in VSCode** (Optional):
   - Launch VSCode and open the repository folder:
     ```bash
     code .
     ```
