# Session 12: Relationship Assessment and Validation (connections.py)

## Session Overview
This session explores how Bonsai v3 assesses and validates relationships between connection points, focusing on the algorithms in the `connections.py` module that ensure biological and statistical consistency.

## Key Topics

### 1. Relationship Specification in Bonsai v3
- Relationship tuple format:
  ```python
  # (degree1, removal1, degree2, removal2, half)
  (1, 0, 1, 0, 0)  # Full siblings
  (1, 0, 0, 0, 1)  # Parent-child
  (2, 0, 2, 0, 0)  # First cousins
  ```
- Conversion between tuples and genealogical relationships
- The relationship space supported by Bonsai v3
- Constraints and validation rules

### 2. Deep Dive into `connections.py`
- Module structure and key components
- Integration with other system modules
- Primary functions and their roles
- Error handling and validation mechanisms

### 3. Relationship Validation Algorithms
- Biological consistency checking:
  - Sex-based constraints for parent relationships
  - Age-based constraints for generational relationships
  - Temporal validity of proposed connections
- Statistical validation:
  - Consistency with IBD evidence
  - Likelihood thresholds for acceptance
  - Confidence scoring for relationships

### 4. Handling Relationship Conflicts
- Detecting contradictory relationship evidence
- Resolution strategies for conflicts
- Prioritization of different evidence types
- Reporting ambiguous or uncertain relationships

### 5. The Relationship Assessment Pipeline
- From connection points to validated relationships:
  1. Generate candidate relationship configurations
  2. Compute likelihoods for each configuration
  3. Filter based on biological constraints
  4. Rank by composite likelihood
  5. Select optimal configuration
- Implementation details and algorithmic considerations

### 6. Creating Relationship-Specific Structures
- Building relationship-specific pedigree fragments
- Handling different relationship types:
  - Direct ancestral relationships
  - Collateral relationships (cousins, etc.)
  - Complex relationships (half-relationships, removed relationships)
- Integration into the existing pedigree structure

### 7. Relationship Likelihood Calibration
- Empirical adjustment of relationship likelihoods
- Population-specific relationship parameters
- Benchmarking against known relationships
- Handling unusual relationship patterns

### 8. Special Case Handling
- Endogamous relationships
- Multiple connections between individuals
- Adoptive or non-biological relationships
- Missing data and uncertain relationships

## Practical Components
- Implementing relationship validation algorithms
- Testing with challenging relationship scenarios
- Calibrating relationship assessment parameters
- Debugging relationship conflicts and resolution

## Recommended Reading
- Papers on relationship inference from genetic data
- Statistical methods for hypothesis testing in relationships
- Literature on biological constraints in genealogy
- Algorithm design for conflict resolution in networks

## Next Session
In our next meeting, we'll explore how Bonsai v3 connects individuals into small pedigree structures, a fundamental building block of the complete pedigree construction process.
