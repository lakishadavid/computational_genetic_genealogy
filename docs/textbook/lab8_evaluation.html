            <h2>Lab 8: Critical Evaluation of IBD Detection Methods</h2>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p><strong>Conceptual Foundations:</strong> This lab explores scientific validation—how we assess the reliability of computational methods and develop principled approaches to method selection. Understanding the strengths and limitations of different algorithms is essential for developing appropriate confidence in research conclusions.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Challenge of Ground Truth in Genetic Analysis</h4>
                <p>A fundamental challenge in genetic genealogy is the absence of absolute ground truth in most real-world scenarios:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Historical Uncertainty:</strong> For most populations, especially those with disrupted historical records, the true genealogical relationships are unknown</li>
                    <li><strong>Documentation Gaps:</strong> Written records often contain errors, omissions, or biases</li>
                    <li><strong>Circular Validation:</strong> Using genetic data to infer relationships that are then used to validate genetic methods creates circular reasoning</li>
                    <li><strong>Simulation Necessity:</strong> Simulated data, where ground truth is known by design, becomes essential for method validation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When evaluating IBD detection methods in this lab, you're working with simulated data where you know the exact segments shared by descent between individuals. This simulation-based evaluation creates the foundation for confidence in real-world applications where ground truth remains unknown.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Metrics as Proxies for Research Value</h4>
                <p>Statistical evaluation metrics serve as proxies for the value of a method in real research contexts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Precision (Positive Predictive Value):</strong> The proportion of detected segments that are truly IBD, representing confidence in positive findings</li>
                    <li><strong>Recall (Sensitivity):</strong> The proportion of true IBD segments that are detected, representing comprehensive detection</li>
                    <li><strong>F1 Score:</strong> The harmonic mean of precision and recall, representing balanced performance</li>
                    <li><strong>Overlap Quality:</strong> How well detected segment boundaries match true segment boundaries, representing detection accuracy</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These metrics create a quantitative framework for method comparison, but their relevance depends on the specific research context. A method with high precision but low recall might be optimal for a project where false positives are particularly problematic, while a high-recall method might be preferable when maximizing the discovery of potential relationships is the priority.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Length-Confidence Relationship in IBD Detection</h4>
                <p>A central tension in IBD detection involves segment length and detection confidence:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Longer Segments:</strong> More confidently detected but represent more recent relationships</li>
                    <li><strong>Shorter Segments:</strong> More challenging to detect reliably but provide information about more distant relationships</li>
                    <li><strong>Temporal Depth Tradeoff:</strong> Pushing detection to shorter segments increases temporal depth but decreases confidence</li>
                    <li><strong>Algorithm-Specific Thresholds:</strong> Each algorithm has its own "reliability horizon" for different segment lengths</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Understanding this relationship is crucial for interpreting IBD results. The evaluation you'll perform in this lab reveals how different algorithms navigate this fundamental tension, providing insight into the appropriate length thresholds for different research questions and algorithms.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Analytical and Statistical Foundations</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Confusion Matrix Framework</h4>
                <p>Evaluation metrics for IBD detection build on the statistical framework of the confusion matrix:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>True Positives (TP):</strong> Correctly detected IBD segments</li>
                    <li><strong>False Positives (FP):</strong> Incorrectly detected segments (not actually IBD)</li>
                    <li><strong>False Negatives (FN):</strong> Missed IBD segments</li>
                    <li><strong>True Negatives (TN):</strong> Correctly not detected non-IBD segments (typically not quantified in IBD evaluation)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The challenge in IBD detection evaluation is defining these categories appropriately. What constitutes a "match" between a detected segment and a true segment? How much overlap is required? These definitional questions have significant implications for evaluation results and typically require making explicit analytical choices that should be clearly documented.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Precision-Recall Curve: A Visualization of Tradeoffs</h4>
                <p>The precision-recall curve visualizes the fundamental tradeoff in detection methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parameter Sensitivity:</strong> Showing how performance changes as algorithm parameters are adjusted</li>
                    <li><strong>Segment Length Effects:</strong> Revealing how performance varies with minimum segment length thresholds</li>
                    <li><strong>Algorithm Comparison:</strong> Providing visual comparison of algorithm behavior across the detection spectrum</li>
                    <li><strong>Operating Point Selection:</strong> Helping researchers select appropriate parameter settings for specific research goals</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This visualization approach moves beyond single-point metrics to reveal the full range of algorithm behavior. By examining these curves, you can understand not just which algorithm performs "best" in a narrow sense, but how different algorithms behave across the spectrum of detection scenarios.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Statistical Properties of Algorithm Errors</h4>
                <p>Algorithms exhibit characteristic error patterns that provide insight into their underlying mechanisms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Error Distribution:</strong> Is error random or systematic? Does it affect certain segment lengths or genomic regions disproportionately?</li>
                    <li><strong>Boundary Precision:</strong> How accurate are the start and end points of detected segments?</li>
                    <li><strong>Splitting/Merging Tendencies:</strong> Does the algorithm tend to fragment single segments or merge adjacent segments?</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Correlation with Genetic Features:</strong> Do errors correlate with features like heterozygosity, recombination rate, or repetitive regions?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The statistical analysis of these error patterns provides deeper insight than summary metrics alone. By understanding the specific ways in which different algorithms fail, researchers can select methods that minimize the types of errors most problematic for their research questions, and appropriately interpret results in light of known error tendencies.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Applications in Genetic Genealogy</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Evidence-Based Algorithm Selection</h4>
                <p>Evaluation results should guide context-appropriate algorithm selection:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Research Question Alignment:</strong> Match algorithm strengths to specific research priorities</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Characteristics:</strong> Consider algorithm performance with your specific data type (phased vs. unphased, SNP density, etc.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Computational Constraints:</strong> Balance performance against computational requirements</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Method Strategies:</strong> Consider using multiple complementary methods for robust results</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Rather than seeking a single "best" algorithm, evaluation results help develop context-specific strategies. For example, a project examining recent relationships in a well-documented community might prioritize precision for high-confidence results, while a project seeking connections among diaspora communities with limited documentation might prioritize recall to discover potential relationships for further investigation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Interpreting Results in Light of Algorithm Limitations</h4>
                <p>Understanding algorithm limitations should inform result interpretation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Confidence Calibration:</strong> Adjust confidence in detected relationships based on known algorithm performance</li>
                    <li><strong>Systematic Bias Awareness:</strong> Account for systematic tendencies in error patterns</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytical Transparency:</strong> Clearly communicate methodological choices and their implications</li>
                    <li><strong>Appropriate Qualification:</strong> Present results with appropriate caveats reflecting algorithm limitations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The evaluation process you'll conduct in this lab provides a foundation for this interpretive approach. By understanding the specific strengths and limitations of each method, you can appropriately qualify conclusions based on those methods, strengthening the overall scientific rigor of genetic genealogy research.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Comparative Analysis for Robust Conclusions</h4>
                <p>Using multiple detection methods can strengthen research conclusions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consensus Approaches:</strong> Highest confidence in segments detected by multiple methods</li>
                    <li><strong>Complementary Strengths:</strong> Methods with different strengths can compensate for each other's weaknesses</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytical Triangulation:</strong> Convergent evidence from multiple methods strengthens findings</li>
                    <li><strong>Uncertainty Characterization:</strong> Disagreement between methods reveals areas of uncertainty</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The comparative evaluation you'll perform in this lab directly informs this multi-method approach. Understanding how different algorithms perform in various contexts allows researchers to design appropriate multi-method strategies and interpret the resulting convergence or divergence in results.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Anthropological and Historical Contexts</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Methodological Rigor in Recovering Disrupted Histories</h4>
                <p>Methodological evaluation has particular significance in anthropological contexts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge Reclamation:</strong> Genetic methods may help recover connections disrupted by historical processes</li>
                    <li><strong>Evidentiary Standards:</strong> Research that informs personal and community identity requires particularly rigorous methods</li>
                    <li><strong>Colonial Legacy Awareness:</strong> Methodological choices can either challenge or reinforce historically biased knowledge frameworks</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethical Responsibility:</strong> The impact of genealogical conclusions on individuals and communities demands methodological care</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When genetic methods are used to address historical gaps created by colonialism, enslavement, or displacement, the methodological rigor demonstrated in this lab becomes an ethical imperative, not just a technical consideration. Understanding method limitations helps ensure that genetic evidence is presented with appropriate qualification and respect for the complexity of historical and personal identity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Population-Specific Performance Considerations</h4>
                <p>Algorithm performance may vary across different populations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reference Bias:</strong> Algorithms developed and tested on predominantly European datasets may perform differently on other populations</li>
                    <li><strong>Demographic History Effects:</strong> Population bottlenecks, expansions, and admixture patterns affect detection performance</li>
                    <li><strong>Endogamy Challenges:</strong> Highly endogamous populations present specific challenges for IBD detection</li>
                    <li><strong>Test Population Representation:</strong> Evaluation should ideally include data representative of the study population</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This population-specific dimension of algorithm performance is particularly important for anthropological applications across diverse global contexts. The evaluation framework you're learning can be extended to assess algorithm performance specifically for the populations relevant to your research, potentially revealing patterns that wouldn't be apparent in generic evaluations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Social Epistemology of Genetic Knowledge</h4>
                <p>Method evaluation connects to broader questions about genetic knowledge creation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge Validation:</strong> How do we establish the validity of genetic relationship claims?</li>
                    <li><strong>Certainty Communication:</strong> How should certainty and uncertainty be communicated to various audiences?</li>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge Integration:</strong> How does genetic evidence integrate with other forms of relationship knowledge?</li>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge Authority:</strong> Who determines what counts as valid evidence of relationships?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The technical evaluation process in this lab connects to these deeper epistemological questions about genetic knowledge. By developing a nuanced understanding of method limitations, you can engage more thoughtfully with questions about how genetic evidence should be weighed alongside other forms of relationship knowledge, including historical records, oral histories, and cultural practices.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
            <p>As you evaluate IBD detection methods in this lab, consider these broader implications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transparency Imperative:</strong> The choices made in evaluation reflect specific values and priorities that should be explicitly acknowledged</li>
                <li><strong>Discipline Evolution:</strong> How might evaluation results guide the development of improved detection methods?</li>
                <li><strong>Context Sensitivity:</strong> How should evaluation results inform different applications of genetic genealogy?</li>
                <li><strong>Responsible Communication:</strong> How can technical limitations be effectively communicated to non-technical audiences?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These considerations connect the technical evaluation process to its broader scholarly and social context. By engaging with these questions, the technical skills you're developing become part of a more holistic approach to genetic genealogy that is both technically rigorous and socially responsible.</p>
