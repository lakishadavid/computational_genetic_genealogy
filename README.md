# Computational Genetic Genealogy Course

This repository contains the complete **Computational Genetic Genealogy** course materials, featuring 30 comprehensive lab notebooks designed to teach genetic genealogy analysis using the Bonsai v3 pedigree reconstruction system.

## üöÄ Quick Start with Google Colab

**No installation required!** All labs run directly in Google Colab with one-click setup.

### How to Use the Labs

1. **Visit the course website**: [Computational Genetic Genealogy Labs](https://lakishadavid.github.io/computational_genetic_genealogy/)

2. **Click "Open in Colab"** for any lab you want to explore

3. **Run the first cell** in the notebook - it will automatically:
   - Install all required dependencies (bioinformatics tools, Python packages)
   - Set up the analysis environment
   - Download essential class data from cloud storage
   - Configure utility functions for saving results

4. **Start learning!** Each lab is self-contained with explanations, code, and exercises.

## üèó Local Development (Optional)

While the course is designed for Google Colab, you can also run it locally:

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 24.04 (or WSL2 with Ubuntu 24.04)
- Python 3.12
- Poetry for dependency management

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lakishadavid/computational_genetic_genealogy.git
cd computational_genetic_genealogy

# Install dependencies
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install --no-root

# Run notebooks locally
poetry run jupyter lab
```

For detailed local setup instructions including bioinformatics tools, see the [Local Setup Guide](docs/local_setup.md).

## üìä Course Data

The course uses a combination of:
- **Simulated genetic data** generated with ped-sim and msprime
- **Real genetic profiles** from the OpenSNP public dataset
- **Reference data** from the 1000 Genomes Project
- **Pedigree examples** demonstrating various relationship structures

All data is automatically downloaded when you run the labs in Google Colab.
