                <p><strong>Core Component:</strong> This lab explores Bonsai v3's prior probability framework, which allows for incorporating demographic information, historical records, and domain-specific knowledge to enhance the accuracy of relationship predictions. Understanding how to develop and integrate custom prior models is essential for adapting Bonsai to specific research contexts.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Power of Prior Probabilities</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Beyond Genetic Data Alone</h4>
                <p>While genetic data provides powerful evidence for relationship inference, incorporating prior knowledge about the relative likelihood of different relationships can significantly enhance prediction accuracy. Bonsai v3's prior probability framework enables this integration:</p>
                
                <h5>The Role of Priors in Bayesian Inference</h5>
                <p>Bonsai's relationship inference follows Bayesian principles, where the posterior probability of a relationship depends on both the likelihood of the observed genetic data and the prior probability of the relationship:</p>
                
                <pre class="code-block">
P(Relationship | Genetic Data) ∝ P(Genetic Data | Relationship) × P(Relationship)</pre>
                
                <p>The prior probability term—<code>P(Relationship)</code>—represents our belief about the relationship probability before considering the genetic evidence. By carefully constructing these priors based on contextual knowledge, we can improve relationship inference accuracy, especially in cases where genetic evidence alone is ambiguous.</p>
                
                <div class="note-box">
                    <h5>When Priors Matter Most</h5>
                    <p>Prior probabilities have the greatest impact in scenarios where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Genetic Evidence is Ambiguous:</strong> When multiple relationships have similar likelihoods</li>
                        <li><strong>Data is Limited:</strong> When genetic data is sparse or uncertain</li>
                        <li><strong>Domain Knowledge is Strong:</strong> When you have reliable contextual information</li>
                        <li><strong>Specific Relationships are Particularly Likely/Unlikely:</strong> When certain relationships have strongly skewed probabilities in your context</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>Bonsai v3 supports several types of prior models, each drawing on different sources of information:</p>
                
                <h5>1. Demographic Prior Models</h5>
                <p>These models use demographic characteristics to inform relationship probabilities:</p>

                    <h5>Uniform vs. Informative Priors</h5>
                    <p>Prior models in Bonsai can range from uniform (all relationships equally likely a priori) to highly informative (strong preference for specific relationships). The choice depends on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Quality:</strong> How reliable is your contextual information?</li>

                        <li><strong>Context:</strong> How strong are the population-level patterns in your research context?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Bonsai generally favors moderately informative priors that guide inference without overwhelming genetic evidence.</p>

                <h4>Ensuring Responsible Prior Specification</h4>
                <p>Developing prior models raises important ethical considerations that must be addressed:</p>
                
                <h5>Potential Ethical Issues</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bias Amplification:</strong> Priors based on biased historical data may perpetuate those biases</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Assumptions:</strong> Prior models may incorporate culturally specific assumptions</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy Implications:</strong> Some prior information may have privacy implications</li>
                    <li><strong>Confirmation Bias:</strong> Priors may be inadvertently selected to confirm expected relationships</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>Best Practices for Ethical Prior Development</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Document all assumptions and data sources used in prior development</li>
                    <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Test priors against diverse datasets to ensure they don't disadvantage specific groups</li>
                    <li><strong>Sensitivity Analysis:</strong> Examine how variations in prior assumptions affect conclusions</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Competence:</strong> Consult with cultural experts when developing priors for specific populations</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> Ensure prior models don't inadvertently reveal sensitive information</li>

                    <h5>Documenting Prior Assumptions</h5>
                    <p>When developing custom prior models, it's important to thoroughly document:</p>
                    <ul>

            <h3>Conclusion and Next Steps</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <p>Custom prior probability models provide a powerful mechanism for integrating domain knowledge, historical records, and demographic information into genetic genealogy analysis. By developing and applying appropriate prior models within Bonsai v3's flexible framework, researchers can significantly enhance the accuracy and contextual relevance of relationship predictions.</p>
                
                <p>The key to effective prior model development lies in carefully balancing informative contextual knowledge with appropriate caution about the strength of prior assumptions. When done well, prior models complement genetic evidence to create more robust and accurate relationship inferences.</p>
                
                <p>In the next lab, we'll explore how Bonsai v3 integrates with other genealogical tools through the DRUID algorithm and other integration mechanisms, enabling comprehensive genetic genealogy workflows.</p>
