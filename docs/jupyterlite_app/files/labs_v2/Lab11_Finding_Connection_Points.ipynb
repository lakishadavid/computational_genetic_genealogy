    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we've explored how Bonsai v3 identifies, evaluates, and implements connection points between individuals and pedigrees. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connection Point Definition**: A connection point in Bonsai is represented as a tuple (id1, id2, dir), where id1 is the primary individual, id2 is an optional partner, and dir indicates the direction of connection (up, down, or lateral/replace).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Finding Connection Points**: The `get_possible_connection_point_set` function identifies all potential connection points in a pedigree, considering each individual and their possible partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Restricting and Prioritizing**: When we have evidence of IBD sharing between pedigrees, Bonsai can restrict and prioritize connection points using the `restrict_connection_point_set` and `get_likely_con_pt_set` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implementing Connections**: We demonstrated how to implement different types of connections (upward, downward, and lateral/replace) and evaluate how well they explain observed genetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation Metrics**: The quality of a connection can be measured by how well it explains the observed IBD sharing patterns across individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding optimal connection points is a central challenge in computational genetic genealogy. The algorithms we've explored form the foundation of Bonsai's ability to reconstruct complex pedigrees from genetic data, allowing it to infer relationships and build family trees that explain observed patterns of DNA sharing."
