            <h3>The Mathematical Framework</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Relationship Representation</h4>
                <p>Bonsai v3 uses a compact tuple representation for genetic relationships that captures the essential genealogical structure. There are two equivalent formats used in different parts of the codebase:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Three-value tuple</strong>: <code>(up, down, num_ancs)</code>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>up</code>: Generations from person 1 to common ancestor</li>
                            <li><code>down</code>: Generations from common ancestor to person 2</li>
                            <li><code>num_ancs</code>: Number of common ancestors (1 for half-relationships, 2 for full relationships)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Five-value tuple</strong>: <code>(degree1, removal1, degree2, removal2, half)</code>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>degree1</code>: Genealogical degree of person 1 (ancestors to common ancestor)</li>
                            <li><code>removal1</code>: Removal for person 1 (generational distance within degree)</li>
                            <li><code>degree2</code>: Genealogical degree of person 2 (ancestors to common ancestor)</li>
                            <li><code>removal2</code>: Removal for person 2 (generational distance within degree)</li>
                            <li><code>half</code>: 1 for half relationships (one common ancestor), 0 for full relationships (two common ancestors)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>The three-value tuple representation is more commonly used in the core algorithmic components. For example, the function <code>get_simple_rel_tuple()</code> in <code>pedigrees.py</code> returns this representation when computing relationships in pedigree structures:</p>
                
                <pre><code>def get_simple_rel_tuple(up_node_dict, id1, id2):
    """Compute the relationship tuple between two individuals in a pedigree.
    
    Args:
        up_node_dict: Dictionary representing the pedigree structure
        id1, id2: IDs of the individuals to compare
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (up, down, num_ancs) representing the relationship
    """</code></pre>
                
                <p>This representation directly encodes the meiotic distance between individuals (<code>up + down</code>), which is the primary determinant of expected IBD sharing patterns. The tuple approach allows the system to represent any possible relationship within a consistent mathematical framework, enabling efficient comparison and computation.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Bayesian Inference for Relationships</h4>
                <p>At its core, Bonsai v3 implements a Bayesian approach to relationship inference. For two individuals with observed IBD data <em>D</em>, the posterior probability of relationship <em>R</em> is calculated as:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="math">P(R|D) = \frac{P(D|R) \cdot P(R)}{P(D)}</code></pre>
                
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>P(R|D)</em> is the posterior probability of relationship <em>R</em> given the observed IBD data</li>
                    <li><em>P(D|R)</em> is the likelihood of observing the IBD data given relationship <em>R</em></li>
                    <li><em>P(R)</em> is the prior probability of relationship <em>R</em></li>
                    <li><em>P(D)</em> is the marginal probability of the IBD data</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Since the goal is to compare different possible relationships for the same IBD data, the denominator <em>P(D)</em> is constant across all relationship hypotheses. This allows Bonsai to focus on the numerator, comparing relationships based on the product of likelihood and prior:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="math">P(R|D) \propto P(D|R) \cdot P(R)</code></pre>
                
                <p>In practice, Bonsai v3 performs these calculations in log space to avoid numerical underflow with very small probabilities:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="math">\log P(R|D) \propto \log P(D|R) + \log P(R)</code></pre>
                
                <p>This Bayesian framework is implemented in the <code>get_relationship_log_like()</code> method of the <code>PwLogLike</code> class, which combines log-likelihoods from multiple sources of evidence with relationship priors to compute posterior log-probabilities.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Relationship Priors</h4>
                <p>Bonsai v3 incorporates prior probabilities for different relationship types, reflecting the relative frequency of these relationships in typical human populations. These priors are implemented in the <code>get_rel_ll_prior()</code> function in the <code>likelihoods.py</code> module:</p>
                
                <pre><code>def get_rel_ll_prior(rel_tuple):
    """Calculate prior log-likelihood for a relationship tuple.
    
    Args:
        rel_tuple: Tuple of (up, down, num_ancs)
        
    Returns:
        Prior log-likelihood
    """
    up, down, num_ancs = rel_tuple
    
    # Calculate meiotic distance
    m = up + down
    
    # No relationship has a very low prior
    if rel_tuple is None:
        return -20.0
    
    # Self-comparison has a low prior in most contexts
    if m == 0 and num_ancs == 2:  # Self
        return -10.0
    
    # Prior decreases with increasing meiotic distance
    base_prior = -0.5 * m
    
    # Full relationships are more common than half relationships
    anc_prior = 0.5 if num_ancs == 2 else 0.0
    
    # Symmetric relationships (up ≈ down) are more common
    sym_prior = -0.2 * abs(up - down)
    
    return base_prior + anc_prior + sym_prior</code></pre>
                
                <p>This prior model encodes several important insights about human kinship patterns:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The probability of relationship decreases with increasing genealogical distance</li>
                    <li>Full relationships (sharing two common ancestors) are more common than half relationships</li>
                    <li>Symmetric relationships (same generation) are more common than asymmetric ones</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The prior serves as a regularization mechanism, guiding the inference process toward more plausible relationships when the genetic evidence alone is ambiguous. This is particularly important for distant relationships where IBD sharing patterns can be highly variable.</p>

            <h3>Statistical Moments of IBD Distributions</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Lambda Parameter</h4>
                <p>The lambda parameter in Bonsai v3 controls the distribution of IBD segment lengths. For a relationship with meiotic distance <em>m</em>, the lambda parameter is calculated as:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="math">\lambda = \frac{m}{100}</code></pre>
                
                <p>This parameter has a direct biological interpretation: it represents the rate of decrease in the probability of observing longer segments, reflecting the increased chances of recombination breaking up segments over more meiotic events.</p>
                
                <p>The lambda parameter determines several key properties of the expected IBD distribution:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The expected mean segment length is approximately <em>100/m</em> centimorgans</li>
                    <li>The probability density function for segment length <em>x</em> is <em>λe<sup>-λx</sup></em></li>
                    <li>The probability that a segment exceeds length <em>t</em> is <em>e<sup>-λt</sup></em></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The <code>get_lam_a_m()</code> function in <code>likelihoods.py</code> implements this calculation with additional refinements for specific relationship types:</p>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Eta Parameter</h4>
                <p>The eta parameter represents the expected number of IBD segments for a relationship. For a relationship with meiotic distance <em>m</em> and <em>a</em> common ancestors, eta is calculated as:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="math">\eta = \frac{a(rm+c)}{2^{m-1}} \cdot e^{-\frac{m \cdot t}{100}}</code></pre>

                    <li><em>c</em> is the number of chromosomes (22 autosomes)</li>
                    <li><em>t</em> is the minimum detectable segment length</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The term <em>rm+c</em> represents the expected number of segments before any filtering</li>
                    <li>The division by <em>2<sup>m-1</sup></em> accounts for the probability of inheriting segments through specific lineages</li>
                    <li>The exponential term accounts for segments that fall below the detection threshold</li>

                <p>This function implements a weighted combination of the count and length likelihoods, with weights that are empirically calibrated to optimize inference accuracy. The weights reflect the relative information content of the different statistics - segment lengths often provide more discriminative power for distinguishing close relationships, while segment counts become more important for distant relationships.</p>
                
                <p>In the actual Bonsai v3 implementation, this function includes additional refinements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Special handling for parent-child relationships, which have distinctive IBD patterns</li>

                </ul>

            <h3>Handling Uncertainty and Stochasticity</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Stochastic Nature of Genetic Inheritance</h4>
                <p>One of the fundamental challenges in genetic relationship inference is the inherently stochastic nature of genetic inheritance. Due to the random processes of meiosis and recombination, even the same relationship type can produce widely varying patterns of IBD sharing.</p>
                
                <p>Key sources of stochasticity include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Random Segregation</strong>: Which chromosomes are inherited from each parent is random</li>
                    <li><strong>Recombination Variability</strong>: The number and location of crossovers during meiosis is variable</li>
                    <li><strong>Sampling Error</strong>: Genotyping covers only a subset of markers, introducing sampling variance</li>
                    <li><strong>Detection Error</strong>: IBD detection algorithms have false positives and false negatives</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This stochasticity means that a single observed IBD pattern could be consistent with multiple possible relationships. For example, the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) for total IBD sharing between second cousins can be as high as 50%, meaning that the actual sharing can easily range from half to double the expected value!</p>
                
                <p>Bonsai v3 explicitly models this stochasticity through the probability distributions in its likelihood functions. The variance parameters in these distributions are calibrated using both theoretical models and empirical data from thousands of known relationships.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Likelihood Ratios and Bayes Factors</h4>
                <p>To quantify uncertainty in relationship inference, Bonsai v3 uses likelihood ratios (also known as Bayes factors) to compare different relationship hypotheses. For two relationship hypotheses R₁ and R₂, the likelihood ratio is:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="math">LR = \frac{P(D|R_1)}{P(D|R_2)}</code></pre>
                
                <p>In log space, this becomes a simple subtraction:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="math">\log LR = \log P(D|R_1) - \log P(D|R_2)</code></pre>
                
                <p>Bonsai v3 implements a function to determine when one hypothesis is significantly better than another:</p>
                
                <pre><code>def is_significantly_better(ll1, ll2, threshold=2.0):
    """Determine if one log-likelihood is significantly better than another.
    
    Args:
        ll1, ll2: Log-likelihood values
        threshold: Difference threshold (default 2.0 ≈ 7.4x more likely)
        
    Returns:
        True if ll1 is significantly better than ll2
    """
    return ll1 - ll2 > threshold</code></pre>
                
                <p>The threshold value of 2.0 corresponds to a likelihood ratio of approximately 7.4, which is often used as a standard for "strong evidence" in Bayesian statistics. When multiple relationship hypotheses have similar likelihoods (differences below the threshold), Bonsai reports the ambiguity rather than making an arbitrary choice.</p>
                
                <p>This approach to uncertainty quantification is critical for reliable pedigree reconstruction, as it prevents the propagation of errors from ambiguous relationships to the larger pedigree structure.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Ambiguous Relationship Cases</h4>
                <p>Certain pairs of relationships are notoriously difficult to distinguish based on IBD patterns alone. The most common ambiguous cases are:</p>
                
                <table class="data-table">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Ambiguous Group</th>
                        <th>Shared DNA</th>
                        <th>Distinguishing Features</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Half-Siblings<br>Grandparent-Grandchild<br>Avuncular (Aunt/Uncle)</td>

                        <td>~12.5%</td>
                        <td>Age differences<br>Segment count</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Half-First Cousins<br>First Cousins Once Removed</td>
                        <td>~6.25%</td>
                        <td>Age differences<br>Generation gap</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Second Cousins<br>Half-First Cousins Once Removed</td>
                        <td>~3.125%</td>
                        <td>Difficult to distinguish reliably</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                
                <p>To address these ambiguities, Bonsai v3 implements several strategies:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Age-Based Disambiguation</strong>: Using age information to distinguish relationships with similar IBD patterns</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple Relationship Paths</strong>: Considering all possible ways individuals might be related</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Constraints</strong>: Using relationships with other individuals to constrain possibilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Explicit Uncertainty Reporting</strong>: Providing confidence scores and alternative hypotheses</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>The <code>get_age_log_like()</code> function in <code>likelihoods.py</code> specifically addresses the first strategy, computing the likelihood of observed age differences under different relationship hypotheses:</p>
                
                <pre><code>def get_age_log_like(age1, age2, rel_tuple):
    """Calculate log-likelihood of age difference for a relationship.
    
    Args:
        age1, age2: Ages of the two individuals
        rel_tuple: (up, down, num_ancs) relationship tuple
        
    Returns:
        Log-likelihood of the age difference
    """</code></pre>
                
                <p>By combining genetic and demographic evidence, Bonsai can often resolve ambiguities that would be impossible to address using IBD patterns alone.</p>

                <li><strong>IBD2 Modeling:</strong> Sophisticated handling of IBD2 regions, particularly for distinguishing close relationships</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-way Relationship Analysis:</strong> Consideration of multiple individuals simultaneously to constrain possible relationships</li>
