    "# Lab 19: Multi-Sample Relationship Inference with Bonsai\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll explore how to use Bonsai for inferring relationships across multiple samples and building larger pedigrees from IBD data. Building on our understanding of Bonsai's architecture and data preprocessing from previous labs, we'll now focus on techniques for connecting multiple individuals into coherent family structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "While pairwise relationship inference is valuable, the real power of genetic genealogy emerges when we can connect multiple individuals into larger family structures. Multi-sample relationship inference allows us to:\n",
    "- Discover complex family relationships that span multiple generations\n",
    "- Identify cryptic relationships that might be unclear from pairwise analysis alone\n",
    "- Reconstruct historical pedigrees with greater accuracy\n",
    "- Resolve ambiguous relationships by considering the broader family context\n",
    "- Overcome challenges posed by missing individuals or sparse genetic data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives**:\n",
    "- Understand the principles behind multi-sample relationship inference\n",
    "- Implement strategies for building consistent pedigrees from IBD data\n",
    "- Apply constraint satisfaction techniques to resolve relationship conflicts\n",
    "- Evaluate the confidence and reliability of inferred pedigree structures\n",
    "- Build effective visualizations of complex pedigrees\n",
    "- Create extensible frameworks for pedigree analysis and construction"

    "### 1.1 From Pairwise to Multi-Sample Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional relationship inference focuses on analyzing pairs of individuals. Multi-sample inference extends this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Considering multiple relationships simultaneously**: Rather than treating relationships as independent pairs, we analyze the entire network of relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enforcing consistency across relationships**: A person cannot be both a grandparent and a sibling to another individual. Multi-sample analysis ensures all inferred relationships are consistent with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Leveraging indirect evidence**: Even without direct IBD sharing between two individuals, we can infer relationships based on their connections to other individuals in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integrating non-genetic information**: Birth years, locations, and historical records can constrain possible pedigree configurations."

    "\n",
    "Multi-sample inference comes with unique challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computational complexity**: The number of possible pedigree configurations grows exponentially with the number of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relationship ambiguity**: Multiple relationship types can explain the observed genetic sharing (e.g., half-siblings vs. uncle-niece).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Missing individuals**: Key relatives may be missing from the dataset, creating \"phantom nodes\" in the pedigree.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conflicting evidence**: Errors in IBD detection or other data sources may lead to inconsistent relationship suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Endogamy and complex family structures**: Historical intermarriage or other complex family structures can create unusual patterns of genetic sharing."

    "Bonsai addresses these challenges through several key strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Up-node dictionary**: Efficiently represents potential ancestral relationships, enabling the algorithm to explore pedigree configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constraint satisfaction**: Enforces biological and logical constraints on pedigree structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Likelihood-based scoring**: Evaluates pedigree configurations based on their probability of generating the observed genetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Incremental construction**: Builds pedigrees incrementally, focusing on high-confidence relationships first.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Optimization algorithms**: Uses techniques like simulated annealing to explore the space of possible pedigree configurations efficiently."
