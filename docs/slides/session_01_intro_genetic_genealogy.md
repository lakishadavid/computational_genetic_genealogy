# Session 1: Introduction to Genetic Genealogy and IBD Concepts

## Session Overview
This introductory session establishes the foundational concepts of genetic genealogy and Identity-by-Descent (IBD) that underpin the Bonsai v3 system.

## Key Topics

### 1. Introduction to Genetic Genealogy
- Definition and scope of computational genetic genealogy
- Historical context and development of the field
- Current applications and impact on genealogical research

### 2. Biological Foundations
- DNA inheritance patterns and recombination
- Segments of genetic material and their significance
- Genetic distance and its relationship to genealogical distance

### 3. Identity-by-Descent (IBD) Fundamentals
- Definition of IBD segments
- Distinction between IBD1 (half-identical) and IBD2 (fully identical) regions
- Connection between shared IBD and shared ancestry

### 4. Measuring and Detecting IBD
- Common units: centiMorgans (cM) and base pairs (bp)
- Overview of IBD detection algorithms (IBIS, RefinedIBD, HapIBD)
- Challenges in IBD detection: phasing, false positives, detection thresholds

### 5. IBD in Relationship Inference
- How IBD patterns indicate relationship types
- Statistical properties of IBD for different relationships
- Using IBD to distinguish relationship degrees and types

### 6. Introduction to Pedigree Reconstruction
- Definition of pedigrees and their components
- Challenges in computational pedigree reconstruction
- Overview of how IBD informs pedigree building

## Practical Components
- Examination of sample IBD segment data
- Interpretation of basic IBD statistics
- Visualization of IBD sharing patterns

## Recommended Reading
- Key papers on IBD detection and relationship inference
- Background material on genetic inheritance models
- Introduction to the mathematical foundations of genetic genealogy

## Next Session
In our next meeting, we'll explore the Bonsai v3 architecture and core data structures that enable efficient pedigree reconstruction from IBD data.
