    "# Lab 7: Up-Node Dictionary and Advanced Pedigree Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab provides a detailed exploration of the up-node dictionary data structure in Bonsai v3, which serves as the foundation for all pedigree operations in the system. Building on Lab06, we'll dive deeper into how this core structure is used throughout the Bonsai codebase, focusing on advanced manipulation operations, navigation algorithms, and applications in complex pedigree reconstruction scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key topics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Core up-node dictionary representation and its mathematical properties\n",
    "2. Advanced operations like re-rooting, trimming, and combining pedigrees\n",
    "3. Algorithms for finding connection points between pedigrees\n",
    "4. Strategies for handling genotyped vs. inferred (latent) individuals\n",
    "5. Optimizations for large-scale pedigree operations\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how the up-node dictionary enables Bonsai's powerful pedigree inference capabilities."

    "The up-node dictionary is the central data structure in Bonsai v3, enabling efficient pedigree representation, manipulation, and analysis. Its design strikes a balance between simplicity, flexibility, and performance, making it suitable for both small, focused analyses and large-scale pedigree reconstruction projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key advantages of this representation include:\n",
    "- Intuitive mapping of individuals to their parents\n",
    "- Clear distinction between observed (genotyped) and inferred individuals\n",
    "- Memory efficiency for sparse pedigrees\n",
    "- Support for bidirectional navigation (via conversion to down-node dictionary)\n",
    "- Ability to represent complex, multi-generational family structures\n",
