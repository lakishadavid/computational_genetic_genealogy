    "This notebook explores the `combine_up_dicts()` algorithm, which is a core component of the Bonsai v3 framework for merging pedigree structures. This algorithm is essential for scaling pedigree reconstruction from small family units to large, complex family trees.\n",

    "1. Examine the actual implementation of `combine_up_dicts()` in the Bonsai v3 codebase\n",
    "2. Understand how pedigrees are merged using optimal connection points\n",
    "3. Create an example that demonstrates the algorithm in action\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we explored the `combine_up_dicts()` algorithm, which is a core component of the Bonsai v3 framework for merging pedigree structures. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `combine_up_dicts()` algorithm iteratively merges pedigrees, starting with those sharing the strongest IBD, until all related pedigrees are combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each merge, Bonsai evaluates multiple possible connection points and relationship types to find the most likely configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The algorithm uses several helper functions like `get_closest_pair()` to identify the best candidates for merging and `combine_pedigrees()` to handle the actual combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The up-node dictionary data structure enables efficient pedigree representation and manipulation during the merging process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Bonsai maintains multiple candidate pedigrees at each step, selecting those with the highest likelihood for further consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows Bonsai to tackle the challenging problem of pedigree reconstruction by breaking it down into smaller, manageable merges, making it possible to reconstruct large and complex family trees from genetic data."
