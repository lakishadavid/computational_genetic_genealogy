            <h2>Lab 1: Exploring Population Genomic Data</h2>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p><strong>Conceptual Foundations:</strong> This lab introduces the fundamental principles of population genomics that form the basis for genetic genealogy. Understanding genetic variation across populations provides the context necessary for interpreting individual genealogical connections.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Human Genetic Variation</h4>
                <p>The human genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs, but individuals differ at only about 0.1% of these positions. These differences, known as genetic variants, are the basis for both population genetics and genetic genealogy. Key points:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms):</strong> Most common type of genetic variation where a single nucleotide differs between individuals</li>
                    <li><strong>Alleles:</strong> Alternative forms of a genetic variant</li>
                    <li><strong>Genotype:</strong> The specific combination of alleles an individual carries (e.g., AA, AG, or GG at a particular position)</li>
                    <li><strong>Haplotype:</strong> A set of genetic variants that tend to be inherited together</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you analyze genetic data in the lab exercises, you're examining patterns in these variants across individuals and populations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Population Genetic Structure</h4>
                <p>Human populations show genetic structure due to historical migration patterns, geographic isolation, and cultural factors. Understanding this structure is crucial for genetic genealogy because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It provides context for interpreting an individual's genetic ancestry</li>
                    <li>It helps distinguish between genetic similarities due to recent common ancestry versus shared population history</li>
                    <li>It informs the expected patterns of genetic sharing between different populations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The 1000 Genomes Project data you'll explore in this lab provides a reference framework for global human genetic diversity, with samples categorized into five continental groups (Africa, Europe, East Asia, South Asia, and the Americas).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Genetic Data Formats</h4>
                <p>Understanding how genetic data is structured is essential for computational analysis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>VCF (Variant Call Format):</strong> The standard file format for representing genetic variants. Each row represents a genetic variant (e.g., a SNP), and each column represents an individual's genotype at that position.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sample Metadata:</strong> Information about each sample, including population, family relationships, and quality metrics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Genotype Representation:</strong> Typically coded as 0 (reference allele) and 1 (alternate allele), with diploid organisms having two values (e.g., 0|0, 0|1, or 1|1).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the computational exercises, you'll learn to parse these formats and extract meaningful information using specialized libraries like <code>allel</code>.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Analytical Frameworks</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Allele Frequency Analysis</h4>
                <p>Allele frequencies—the proportion of a specific allele in a population—are fundamental to understanding genetic variation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They vary across populations due to evolutionary processes (natural selection, genetic drift, migration)</li>
                    <li>Population-specific allele frequencies serve as reference points for ancestry estimation</li>
                    <li>Rare variants (low frequency) are often more recent and may be informative for closer genealogical relationships</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When calculating allele frequencies in the lab, you're quantifying how common different genetic variants are in each population, which provides insights into population history and structure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Population Genetics</h4>
                <p>PCA is a powerful dimension reduction technique that transforms complex genetic data into a smaller number of components that capture most of the variation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In population genetics, PCA can visually represent genetic relationships between individuals and populations</li>
                    <li>The first principal component (PC1) typically separates populations with the greatest genetic differentiation</li>
                    <li>Subsequent components (PC2, PC3, etc.) capture additional patterns of variation</li>
                    <li>Individuals from the same population tend to cluster together in PCA plots</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The PCA visualization you'll create in this lab reveals how genetic variation is structured across global populations and provides a framework for understanding an individual's genetic ancestry.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Fixation Index (FST)</h4>
                <p>FST is a measure of genetic differentiation between populations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Values range from 0 (no differentiation) to 1 (complete differentiation)</li>
                    <li>Higher FST values indicate greater genetic differences between populations</li>
                    <li>FST calculations help quantify the degree of genetic isolation between populations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By calculating FST between population pairs in the lab exercises, you're measuring the genetic "distance" between populations, which reflects their evolutionary history and the degree of migration between them.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Application to Genetic Genealogy</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Population References for Genealogical Analysis</h4>
                <p>The population genetic patterns you explore in this lab form the foundation for genetic genealogy applications:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ancestry Estimation:</strong> Population reference panels enable algorithms to estimate an individual's genetic ancestry proportions</li>
                    <li><strong>IBD Detection Context:</strong> Population allele frequencies inform the likelihood that shared segments are identical by descent (IBD) versus identical by state (IBS)</li>
                    <li><strong>Relationship Inference:</strong> Population-specific genetic patterns help calibrate models for inferring genealogical relationships</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Understanding these population patterns is crucial for accurately interpreting genetic connections between individuals, especially those with ancestry from multiple populations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Anthropological Significance</h4>
                <p>From an anthropological perspective, population genetic patterns reflect human history and cultural processes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Human Origins:</strong> The greater genetic diversity in African populations supports the "Out of Africa" model of human evolution</li>
                    <li><strong>Migration Patterns:</strong> Genetic similarity between populations often correlates with historical migration routes</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Structures:</strong> Patterns of genetic variation can reflect historical social practices (e.g., marriage patterns, cultural isolation)</li>
                    <li><strong>Admixture Events:</strong> Genetic evidence of population mixing corresponds to historical events like colonization and forced migration</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The 1000 Genomes data you'll analyze captures these historical processes through genetic patterns, connecting biological inheritance to human cultural and social history.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
            <p>As you work through the coding exercises in this lab, keep in mind these deeper concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biological vs. Social Identity:</strong> Genetic patterns reflect biological inheritance but don't necessarily align with social or cultural identities</li>
                <li><strong>Statistical Nature:</strong> Population genetic patterns are statistical generalizations and individual genetic profiles may not perfectly match population averages</li>
                <li><strong>Temporal Dynamics:</strong> Genetic patterns change over time due to migration, admixture, and other processes</li>
                <li><strong>Interpretive Context:</strong> Genetic data must be interpreted within historical, social, and cultural contexts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These conceptual frameworks will help you move beyond simple data manipulation to a deeper understanding of what genetic patterns reveal about human relationships and history.</p>
