    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we explored the core pedigree data structures in the Bonsai v3 codebase. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fundamental Data Structures**: Bonsai represents pedigrees using two primary dictionary structures - `up_node_dict` (mapping individuals to their ancestors) and `down_node_dict` (mapping individuals to their descendants).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relationship Representation**: Relationships are represented as tuples of the form `(up, down, num_ancs)`, where `up` is the number of meioses up to the common ancestor, `down` is the number of meioses down from the common ancestor, and `num_ancs` is the number of common ancestors (1 for half relationships, 2 for full relationships).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Navigation and Querying**: Bonsai provides a rich set of functions for navigating pedigrees, including finding ancestors, descendants, siblings, and computing relationships between individuals. Key functions include `get_rel_set()`, `get_all_paths()`, and `get_simple_rel_tuple()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Building and Modification**: The codebase includes functions for building and modifying pedigrees, such as adding parents, deleting nodes, and replacing IDs. These functions allow for sophisticated manipulation of pedigree structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handling Consanguinity**: Bonsai's pedigree representation can handle complex scenarios like consanguinity (inbreeding), where individuals may be related through multiple paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these fundamental data structures and functions is essential for working with Bonsai v3, as they form the foundation upon which more complex algorithms for relationship inference and pedigree reconstruction are built."
