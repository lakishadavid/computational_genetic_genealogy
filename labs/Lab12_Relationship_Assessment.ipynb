   "source": "## Summary\n\nIn this lab, we've explored how Bonsai v3 assesses and validates relationships between individuals in a pedigree. We've examined the actual implementation of key functions and provided simplified versions for educational purposes. Key takeaways include:\n\n1. **Understanding Bonsai v3's Core Functions**: We examined the source code of crucial functions like `is_valid_relationship`, `passes_age_check`, and `assess_connections` to understand how Bonsai validates and evaluates relationships.\n\n2. **Biological Validation**: Bonsai validates relationships using biological constraints such as sex and age. Functions like `is_valid_relationship` and `passes_age_check` ensure that proposed relationships are biologically plausible.\n\n3. **IBD-Based Assessment**: The `assess_connections` function evaluates how well a proposed relationship explains observed IBD sharing. This involves comparing observed IBD to expected values based on relationship type.\n\n4. **Relationship Inference**: By testing multiple possible relationships and selecting the one with the highest score, Bonsai can infer the most likely relationship between two individuals based on their genetic sharing.\n\n5. **Pedigree Building**: These relationship assessment techniques form the foundation of Bonsai's pedigree reconstruction capabilities, allowing it to build pedigrees that best explain the observed genetic data.\n\n6. **Conflict Resolution**: When multiple relationship hypotheses are plausible, Bonsai can rank them by likelihood, helping users identify the most probable relationships.\n\n7. **Integration in Bonsai's Workflow**: We saw how these functions are integrated into Bonsai v3's larger workflow, with functions like `combine_pedigrees` and `combine_up_dicts` handling the actual construction of complete pedigrees.\n\nUnderstanding these relationship assessment mechanisms is crucial for effective pedigree reconstruction in genetic genealogy, as they determine which relationships are included in the final pedigree and how conflicting evidence is resolved.",
