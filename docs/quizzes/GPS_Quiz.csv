MC,,5,What is the primary goal of the Genealogical Proof Standard?,2,"To ensure genealogical findings are based solely on one definitive source, typically a government-issued certificate.","To establish that genealogical conclusions are based on sound research, accurate sources, and logical reasoning.",To promote visual consistency in family tree charts across genealogical communities for publication.,To enforce that only certified professionals are permitted to publish genealogical conclusions in public forums.,
MC,,5,Which of the following best represents reasonably exhaustive research?,3,"Limiting the scope to records that are digitally indexed, assuming others are less relevant or inaccessible.",Prioritizing modern DNA tools over traditional documents when drawing conclusions about relationships.,"Investigating multiple, diverse sources—including conflicting ones—until no new relevant evidence is expected.",Confirming a match through online trees without checking whether they contain original sources.,
MC,,5,Why is citation a necessary element in genealogical research?,2,Because citations are optional for informal research shared only with family members.,"Because it enables others to verify, evaluate, and replicate the research conclusions drawn.","Because the citation style demonstrates academic pedigree, even if sources are not accessible.",Because only citations from peer-reviewed journals are necessary to support conclusions.,
MC,,5,What does it mean to correlate sources and evidence in genealogy?,4,To sort all records in a chronological list before beginning analysis or drawing conclusions.,To tag sources with numerical ratings to assess their perceived reliability in a visual grid.,To prioritize official government documents over private records when weighing evidence.,"To compare and synthesize information across multiple sources to identify patterns, gaps, and inconsistencies.",
MC,,5,What is the correct response when genealogical evidence from two reliable sources contradicts?,1,"Analyze the conflict and attempt to resolve it using context, reliability, and corroboration from other sources.","Favor the most frequently cited version of the event in online trees, even if no original source is present.",Assume the version that aligns most closely with family oral tradition is inherently more trustworthy.,Present both sources as equally valid without further inquiry into reliability or context.,
MC,,5,What defines a ‘reasonably exhaustive search’?,3,Consulting records for a limited time period around a known date and ceasing further exploration.,"Confirming that a single online tree with complete lineage exists, then using that information directly.","Considering all relevant records likely to shed light on the question, including negative and conflicting evidence.",Identifying at least one official government-issued certificate that supports a genealogical claim.,
MC,,5,Why should genealogists include negative evidence in their analysis?,1,Because the absence of expected information in a source can provide valuable insight or raise critical questions.,"Because citations are strengthened by mentioning every source that was viewed, regardless of content.",Because it helps maintain a standardized length for research summaries and client reports.,Because omitting evidence that yields no result can suggest bias or selective reporting of sources.,
MC,,5,What makes a genealogical conclusion ‘soundly reasoned’?,2,"It follows a linear timeline and includes one strong, original source to validate the claim.","It is logically constructed, supported by multiple forms of evidence, and addresses ambiguities or conflicts.",It reflects the oldest known story passed down through generations without deviation.,"It is confirmed by at least one other researcher, regardless of the documentation they used.",
MC,,5,What role does context play in source analysis?,3,It allows the researcher to identify whether the handwriting and format match modern standards.,It helps researchers determine whether the original or a transcript version of a record is preferable.,It reveals whether the source was created near the time of the event and under what circumstances it was recorded.,It determines the number of generations between the informant and the subject of the record.,
MC,,5,Which best exemplifies accurate source citation?,2,"Including just the name of the individual, the record title, and the year of the event.","Providing complete details: type of record, where it was found, when it was accessed, and any digital locator.",Describing the general source repository instead of specifying individual record collections.,"Limiting citations to only those sources that were used in drawing final conclusions, not exploratory steps.",
MC,,5,How does the Genealogical Proof Standard treat conflicting evidence?,3,It must be avoided at all costs because conflict undermines credibility.,It should be acknowledged briefly but does not need to be resolved in a conclusion.,"It must be addressed, weighed in context, and resolved through careful comparison and additional research.",It can be ignored if the conflict exists only in derivative sources or indexes.,
MC,,5,What is the difference between a source and information?,2,A source and its information are synonymous and interchangeable in most genealogical applications.,A source is the physical or digital container of evidence; information is the content derived from it.,"A source provides evidence only if cited by a professional genealogist; otherwise, it is not valid.","Information is reliable only if it is extracted from DNA, not written documentation.",
MC,,5,What is direct evidence?,1,Evidence that directly answers a genealogical research question without requiring inference.,Evidence found in two independent sources that appear to match on name and location.,"A written record created at the time of the event, regardless of content relevance.",Any information that originates in a handwritten document or original register.,
MC,,5,What is indirect evidence in genealogical research?,4,"A source that has incomplete fields or faded ink, making it difficult to read.",Information found in online trees that has not yet been confirmed by primary documents.,A newspaper obituary with a list of survivors but no explicit relationship statement.,Evidence that must be pieced together from multiple sources to answer a specific research question.,
MC,,5,Which of the following is most important when citing a digital source?,3,Listing the web address where the source was originally scanned or uploaded.,Noting whether the source was obtained via free access or subscription.,"Including the original source details, the hosting website, and the date of access.",Highlighting the filename of the downloaded document for later retrieval.,
MC,,5,What is one risk of relying solely on compiled genealogies without verifying the sources?,1,They may contain perpetuated errors that mislead future research efforts.,They are often too short to provide meaningful context for the individuals listed.,They are usually based on oral traditions and therefore are inherently more reliable.,They include fewer citations because they rely on shared community knowledge.,
MC,,5,How does a research report demonstrate application of the GPS?,2,By summarizing the family’s known oral history and placing it in a formal document.,"By outlining the research process, evaluating evidence, and presenting conclusions with supporting citations.",By presenting DNA results alongside a family tree diagram with limited analysis.,By limiting discussion to proven facts without considering conflicting or indirect evidence.,
MC,,5,What does ‘reasonably exhaustive’ not require?,3,"A broad review of relevant original, derivative, and compiled sources.",Attention to the context and availability of records for a given time and location.,Searching every existing record in all repositories regardless of relevance or feasibility.,Consideration of sources that include both positive and negative results.,
MC,,5,Why is DNA evidence not always sufficient to meet the GPS?,2,Because DNA offers definitive proof of ancestry and should be accepted without question.,Because DNA requires documentary correlation and can be ambiguous without context.,Because only autosomal DNA is accepted under GPS guidelines.,Because DNA results must be validated by third-party genealogists in every case.,
MC,,5,Which of the following best represents a complete resolution of conflicting evidence?,4,Choosing the source that appears most frequently in online databases.,Accepting the record that confirms family oral tradition and disregarding the rest.,Selecting the most recent document under the assumption that it corrects earlier records.,"Analyzing all conflicting sources and justifying the conclusion through reliability, context, and supporting records.",
MC,,5,What is one reason genealogists write research summaries?,1,"To clearly communicate their findings, research steps, and logic behind conclusions for transparency and peer review.",To create a formal document that showcases their writing style for prospective clients or journal editors.,To replace traditional family trees with narrative descriptions of family history.,To offer a personal reflection on the emotional impact of the research findings.,
MC,,5,What distinguishes original sources from derivative ones?,2,"Original sources are handwritten, while derivative sources are always typewritten.",Original sources are created at or near the time of an event; derivative sources are summaries or transcriptions of the original.,Original sources can only be obtained from national archives; derivative sources are online versions.,Derivative sources are less valid and cannot be used in genealogical proof cases.,
MC,,5,When is it appropriate to stop a genealogical search?,4,As soon as you locate a record that confirms part of your hypothesis without contradiction.,"After two sources agree, even if they are from similar types of documents.",Once the oral history is confirmed through one historical newspaper article.,When no new relevant sources are likely to be found and existing evidence is sufficient to reach a sound conclusion.,
MC,,5,What is the best way to address a lack of records for a particular ancestor?,3,"Rely exclusively on oral history or DNA evidence, depending on what is most readily available.",Make a note of the missing ancestor and exclude them from further consideration to maintain accuracy.,"Use contextual, indirect, and negative evidence from related individuals and communities to build a case.",Search only recent records in the hope that earlier references will eventually appear.,
MC,,5,Why is it important to identify the informant in a genealogical record?,2,To determine whether the informant can be contacted for additional interviews or records.,To evaluate the informant’s relationship to the subject and assess how much they likely knew.,To verify whether the informant was literate and therefore more trustworthy.,To ensure that the same person provided information for every document in a file.,
MC,,5,Which of the following demonstrates indirect evidence?,4,A death certificate that clearly names both parents and place of birth.,"A census record that confirms an individual's age, birthplace, and occupation.",A military record listing next-of-kin and enlistment date for a specific individual.,A collection of records that together imply a conclusion not stated outright in any single source.,
MC,,5,Which of the following statements best supports a soundly reasoned conclusion?,3,The findings match a story passed down through three generations of family members.,"Another genealogist published the same conclusion, so the information is probably accurate.","Multiple sources were examined, conflicts were addressed, and a logical argument was constructed based on evidence.","The conclusion was based on official government records exclusively, making it inherently accurate.",
MC,,5,What is one benefit of resolving contradictory evidence?,1,It strengthens the reliability of the conclusion by demonstrating thoughtful analysis and source comparison.,It allows researchers to avoid presenting uncomfortable or ambiguous evidence.,It justifies limiting the citation list to only the sources that support the preferred narrative.,It guarantees that future researchers will reach the same conclusion without further investigation.,
MC,,5,How does the GPS encourage transparency in genealogy?,2,By recommending that conclusions be shared only in academic settings to avoid misinterpretation.,"By requiring clear citations, logical explanations, and documentation of the research process.",By encouraging researchers to rely on verified databases without sharing their raw notes.,By setting strict limits on the number of sources cited in a published genealogy.,
MC,,5,Why is the GPS relevant to both professional and non-professional genealogists?,4,It provides a legal standard used in inheritance and immigration cases worldwide.,It replaces the need for genealogists to reference external methodologies or standards.,It ensures that only credentialed professionals can publish genealogical information online.,"It offers a universally applicable framework for conducting, presenting, and evaluating high-quality genealogy.",
