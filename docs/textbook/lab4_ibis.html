            <h2>Lab 4: Identity-by-Descent (IBD) Detection with IBIS</h2>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p><strong>Conceptual Foundations:</strong> This lab introduces the identification of genetic segments shared between individuals due to inheritance from a common ancestor—the core concept underlying genetic genealogy. You'll learn how algorithms detect these segments and how they form the foundation for relationship inference.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Identity by Descent (IBD): The Genetic Basis of Family Relationships</h4>
                <p>Identity by Descent (IBD) is the cornerstone concept of genetic genealogy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> DNA segments shared between two individuals because they inherited them from a common ancestor</li>
                    <li><strong>Distinction from IBS:</strong> Unlike Identity by State (IBS), which refers to identical DNA that may be coincidental, IBD specifically indicates inheritance from a shared ancestor</li>
                    <li><strong>Genetic Evidence:</strong> IBD segments are the primary genetic evidence of family relationships</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The IBIS algorithm you'll implement in this lab is designed specifically to identify these IBD segments in genetic data, providing the foundation for reconstructing genealogical connections between individuals.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Genetic Recombination and IBD Patterns</h4>
                <p>Understanding genetic recombination is essential for interpreting IBD detections:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Recombination Process:</strong> During meiosis (formation of egg and sperm cells), chromosomes exchange segments in a process called recombination</li>
                    <li><strong>Segment Breaking:</strong> Each generation, recombination breaks IBD segments into smaller pieces</li>
                    <li><strong>Length-Relationship Correlation:</strong> Longer IBD segments typically indicate more recent common ancestors</li>
                    <li><strong>Segment Distribution:</strong> The number, length, and genomic distribution of IBD segments form a signature of relationship type</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When IBIS detects IBD segments, it's identifying the remnants of genetic material that has survived this recombination process across multiple generations, preserving evidence of ancestral connections.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Difference Between Phased and Unphased Data</h4>
                <p>IBIS is notable for its ability to work with unphased data, a key consideration in genetic genealogy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Phased Data:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Genetic data where maternal and paternal alleles are distinguished</li>
                            <li>More powerful for IBD detection but requires additional processing</li>
                            <li>Required for most advanced IBD detection algorithms</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Unphased Data:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Genetic data where maternal and paternal alleles are not distinguished</li>
                            <li>The standard output from consumer genetic testing</li>
                            <li>More challenging for IBD detection, but more widely available</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>IBIS's ability to work directly with unphased data makes it particularly useful for analyzing consumer genetic test results, as it eliminates the potentially error-prone phasing step required by other algorithms.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Algorithmic Approaches and Methodology</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The IBIS Algorithm: Principles and Innovation</h4>
                <p>IBIS (Identity By Information Score) employs several key statistical and computational concepts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Probabilistic Framework:</strong> IBIS calculates the likelihood that observed genotype similarity is due to IBD rather than chance</li>
                    <li><strong>Information Content:</strong> Each genetic marker is weighted based on its informativeness (related to allele frequency)</li>
                    <li><strong>Windowing Approach:</strong> IBIS analyzes the genome in overlapping windows to identify segments with elevated IBD probability</li>
                    <li><strong>Hidden Markov Model:</strong> The algorithm models the transition between IBD and non-IBD states across the genome</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The code you'll work with in this lab executes these complex statistical calculations, transforming raw genotype data into inferences about genetic relationships.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Critical Parameters and Their Impact</h4>
                <p>Understanding key parameters in IBD detection algorithms is essential for effective analysis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Minimum Segment Length:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Controls the shortest IBD segment that will be reported</li>
                            <li>Shorter thresholds increase sensitivity but also false positives</li>
                            <li>Typically measured in centimorgans (cM), a genetic distance unit</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>LOD Score Threshold:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Log of odds score indicating confidence in IBD detection</li>
                            <li>Higher thresholds increase specificity but may miss true segments</li>
                            <li>Represents the statistical evidence for IBD vs. random matching</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Genetic Map:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Translates physical positions (base pairs) to genetic distances (centimorgans)</li>
                            <li>Accounts for variable recombination rates across the genome</li>
                            <li>Critical for accurate length estimation of IBD segments</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The parameter choices you make when running IBIS represent a tradeoff between sensitivity (finding all true IBD) and specificity (avoiding false positives)—a fundamental consideration in all genetic analysis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>IBD Segment Filtering and Processing</h4>
                <p>Raw IBD detections typically require post-processing to maximize biological relevance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gap Filling:</strong> Small gaps between nearby IBD segments may be artifacts and can be merged</li>
                    <li><strong>Length Filtering:</strong> Very short segments have higher false positive rates and may be filtered</li>
                    <li><strong>Overlapping Segments:</strong> Detection of segments on both chromosome copies requires special handling</li>
                    <li><strong>Population-Specific Considerations:</strong> Detection parameters may need adjustment for different ancestral backgrounds</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The post-processing steps in the lab code are not just technical procedures but analytical decisions that affect genealogical inferences, illustrating the interplay between computational methods and biological interpretation.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Applications in Genetic Genealogy</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>From IBD Segments to Relationship Inference</h4>
                <p>The IBD segments detected by IBIS form the foundation for relationship inference:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Total Sharing:</strong> The total amount of IBD sharing correlates with relationship closeness</li>
                    <li><strong>Segment Distribution:</strong> Pattern of segments across chromosomes helps distinguish relationship types</li>
                    <li><strong>Length Distribution:</strong> Distribution of segment lengths provides clues about relationship age</li>
                    <li><strong>Triangulation:</strong> Comparing IBD segments shared among multiple individuals can identify common ancestors</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you analyze the output of IBIS in this lab, you're not just working with abstract data segments but with genetic evidence of family connections that can span generations.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Anthropological Significance</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>IBD Patterns as Records of Human History</h4>
                <p>From an anthropological perspective, IBD patterns detected across a population contain valuable historical information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Population Bottlenecks:</strong> Elevated IBD sharing within a population can indicate historical population reductions</li>
                    <li><strong>Migration Patterns:</strong> IBD segments between populations reveal historical migration and admixture</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Practices:</strong> Marriage patterns and social structures influence IBD distribution</li>
                    <li><strong>Founder Effects:</strong> Recent population establishments show characteristic IBD signatures</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The IBD analysis techniques you're learning have applications beyond individual genealogy, informing our understanding of human population history and movement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Reconstructing Diaspora Connections</h4>
