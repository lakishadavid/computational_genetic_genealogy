    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we've explored the up-node dictionary, a core data structure in Bonsai v3 for representing pedigrees. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structure and Design**: The up-node dictionary is a powerful, flexible representation where each key is an individual ID, and each value is a dictionary mapping parent IDs to degrees of relationship. This design efficiently encodes ancestral relationships and can represent complex pedigree structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ID Conventions**: The Bonsai v3 pedigree representation uses positive IDs for genotyped individuals and negative IDs for ungenotyped/inferred individuals. Empty dictionaries represent founders (individuals with no recorded parents).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Relationship Representation**: Relationships are encoded as tuples (up, down, num_ancs), where up is the number of meioses up to the common ancestor, down is the number of meioses down to the second individual, and num_ancs is the number of common ancestors (1 for half relationships, 2 for full relationships).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Key Operations**: Bonsai v3 provides a rich set of functions for working with pedigrees, including finding ancestors/descendants, determining relationships, extracting subtrees, and identifying common ancestors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bidirectional Navigation**: By converting between up-node and down-node dictionaries, we can efficiently navigate both up (toward ancestors) and down (toward descendants) through the pedigree.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Advanced Applications**: The up-node dictionary structure supports advanced operations like finding connection points between pedigrees, analyzing relationship distributions, and handling complex structures like consanguinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The up-node dictionary is the foundation upon which the Bonsai v3 algorithms operate, enabling efficient pedigree construction, analysis, and inference from genetic data."
