    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab explores the `PwLogLike` class, a core component of Bonsai v3 responsible for calculating relationship likelihoods based on IBD data. The class combines genetic evidence with demographic information to infer relationships between pairs of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key topics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structure and initialization of the `PwLogLike` class\n",
    "2. Methods for calculating genetic likelihoods from IBD data\n",
    "3. Age-based relationship likelihood computation\n",
    "4. Integration of multiple evidence sources\n",
    "5. Practical applications in relationship inference\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you'll understand how the `PwLogLike` class serves as the quantitative foundation for Bonsai's pedigree reconstruction capabilities."

    "1. **Input Parameters**:\n",
    "   - `id1`, `id2`: IDs of the two individuals\n",
    "   - `relationship_tuple`: (up, down, num_ancs) tuple representing the relationship\n",
    "   - `condition`: Whether to condition on observing IBD\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processing Steps**:\n",
    "   - Calculates the genetic likelihood (`get_pw_gen_ll`)\n",
    "   - Optionally calculates the age-based likelihood (`get_pw_age_ll`)\n",
    "   - Combines the likelihoods with appropriate weights\n",

    "1. **Class Structure**: The `PwLogLike` class combines IBD statistics and demographic information to calculate relationship likelihoods.\n",
