            <h2>Lab 0: Setting Up Your Computational Environment</h2>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> The infrastructure we build shapes the questions we can ask. In computational anthropology, our digital tools and environments determine our ability to bridge biological data and human stories across generations. Proper setup ensures we can ethically, accurately, and efficiently transform genetic patterns into meaningful insights about human connections.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>The Digital Infrastructure of Genetic Anthropology</h4>
                <p>Computational environments are more than just collections of software—they are the foundation upon which genetic anthropology builds its understanding of human connections. The tools we use shape not only what we can discover but also how we interpret our findings and the ethical boundaries of our work.</p>
                
                <p>In genetic genealogy, our computational infrastructure must balance several critical requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scientific Reproducibility</strong>: Results must be replicable across different researchers and settings</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Security</strong>: Genetic information requires robust protection due to its sensitive nature</li>
                    <li><strong>Computational Efficiency</strong>: Analyses must scale to handle large genomic datasets</li>
                    <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Integration</strong>: Tools must bridge biological, computational, and anthropological perspectives</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethical Compliance</strong>: Infrastructure must support responsible handling of culturally and personally sensitive information</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <p>The environment we construct is not neutral—it embodies choices about whose data matters, which methods we privilege, and what kinds of questions we can explore. Recognizing this helps us build more inclusive and ethically robust research practices.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Containerization as Cultural Exchange</h4>
                <p>Docker containerization represents more than just a technical solution—it embodies a fundamental anthropological principle: cultural transmission of complex knowledge systems. Containers allow us to package entire technological ecosystems, complete with their interdependencies and configurations, and share them across diverse computing environments.</p>
                
                <p>This approach parallels traditional knowledge systems where specialized tools, practices, and understandings are transmitted as integrated packages. In both cases, the goal is to preserve the integrity of a knowledge practice while allowing its application in new contexts.</p>
                
                <p>For genetic genealogy specifically, containerization ensures that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analytical results aren't artifacts of different computing environments</li>
                    <li>Communities can collaborate across diverse technical backgrounds</li>
                    <li>Research methods become more accessible to scholars from different disciplines</li>
                    <li>Knowledge is democratized rather than restricted to those with specialized infrastructure</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <p>This infrastructure approach aligns with anthropology's commitment to preserving knowledge diversity while facilitating cross-cultural exchange.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Technical Foundations</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4 id="python">The Bioinformatics Toolkit</h4>
                <p>The specialized tools used in computational genetic genealogy represent the intersection of multiple knowledge traditions: population genetics, computer science, statistical modeling, and information visualization. Each tool encapsulates theoretical frameworks and assumptions that shape our analytical possibilities.</p>
                
                <p>Key tools in our environment include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Processing Tools</strong> (bcftools, samtools): These transform raw genetic data into structured formats, reflecting decisions about what genetic information is relevant and how it should be represented</li>
                    <li><strong>Statistical Analysis Tools</strong> (PLINK): These implement mathematical models of genetic inheritance and variation, embodying theoretical frameworks for understanding population structure</li>
                    <li><strong>IBD Detection Algorithms</strong> (IBIS, Hap-IBD, Refined-IBD): These identify shared genetic segments, operationalizing biological concepts of genetic relatedness through computational methods</li>
                    <li><strong>Simulation Frameworks</strong> (Ped-Sim): These create synthetic data based on models of genetic inheritance, allowing us to test hypotheses about genetic transmission</li>
                    <li><strong>Pedigree Reconstruction Tools</strong> (BonsaiTree): These infer family relationships from genetic patterns, bridging biological data and genealogical structures</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <p>Each tool represents a theoretical position on how genetic information relates to human relationships. Understanding these positions helps us interpret results with appropriate nuance and recognize the limitations of our analyses.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Digital Organization as Methodology</h4>
                <p>The organization of our digital workspace reflects methodological choices about how we understand the relationship between genetic data and human stories. Our directory structure embodies a conceptual framework that separates:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Raw Data</strong>: The biological information extracted from genetic samples</li>
                    <li><strong>Reference Materials</strong>: The comparative standards against which we interpret individual variation</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytical Results</strong>: The derived patterns that connect genetic information to kinship narratives</li>
                    <li><strong>Methodological Tools</strong>: The processes through which we transform data into meaningful relationships</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <p>This organization isn't merely convenient—it reflects a philosophical position about the transformation of biological information into anthropological knowledge. By separating raw data from interpretations, we acknowledge that genetic information doesn't speak for itself but requires contextual interpretation to become meaningful for understanding human relationships.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Practical Applications</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Setting Up Your Research Environment</h4>
                <p>The process of establishing your computational environment involves several key steps:</p>
                
                <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 2rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 280px; background-color: rgba(94, 48, 35, 0.03); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; border-top: 3px solid var(--primary);">
                        <h5 style="color: var(--primary); margin-top: 0;">Docker Approach (Recommended)</h5>
                        <p>This approach uses containerization to create a standardized environment that works consistently across different computing systems:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Install Docker on your local system</li>
                            <li>Pull the course image (<code>docker pull lakishadavid/cgg_image:latest</code>)</li>
                            <li>Launch a container with your local directories mapped for data persistence</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 280px; background-color: rgba(57, 135, 123, 0.03); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; border-top: 3px solid var(--accent);">
                        <h5 style="color: var(--accent); margin-top: 0;">Local Installation Alternative</h5>
                        <p>This approach builds the environment directly on your local system:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Install core system dependencies</li>
                            <li>Compile bioinformatics tools from source</li>
                            <li>Configure Python and Java environments</li>
                            <li>Install specialized genetic analysis tools</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <p>These approaches represent different philosophies about research infrastructure—containerization prioritizes consistency and reproducibility, while local installation offers more customization and direct system integration. The choice between them often reflects broader research values around standardization versus flexibility.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4 id="troubleshooting">Verifying Your Environment</h4>
                <p>Environment verification isn't merely a technical step but a process of establishing trust in your research infrastructure. By checking tool versions and functionality, you're ensuring that your analytical results will be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reproducible</strong>: Others can replicate your findings using the same tools</li>
