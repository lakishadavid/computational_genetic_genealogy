    "# Understanding the MSprime Simulation Script\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script is designed to simulate genetic data using the `msprime` library, with a focus on modeling inheritance patterns through predefined pedigree structures. The script simulates genetic recombination, mutation, and tracks Identity By Descent (IBD) segments across generations. Below is a comprehensive explanation of its key components and workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "The script performs the following major functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pedigree-Based Genetic Simulation**: Simulates genetic inheritance within a defined family structure\n",
    "2. **Multi-Chromosome Modeling**: Handles multiple chromosomes with appropriate recombination rates between them\n",
    "3. **IBD Segment Analysis**: Identifies and tracks segments of DNA that are identical by descent\n",
    "4. **MRCA (Most Recent Common Ancestor) Calculation**: Determines the most recent common ancestors for pairs of individuals\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setup and Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Command Line Arguments**: Configurable parameters include:\n",
    "  - Number of simulation replicates\n",
    "  - Minimum IBD segment length\n",
    "  - Maximum time to look back for IBD segments\n",
    "  - Mutation rate\n",
    "  - Chromosomes to simulate\n",
    "  - Genetic map to use\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Environment Setup**: The script attempts to locate a `.env` file with predefined directory paths for storing results, data, and references.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Genetic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demographic Model**: Uses the \"American Admixture\" model from the `stdpopsim` library (Browning et al. 2011)\n",
    "- **Recombination Maps**: Implements chromosome-specific genetic maps to model realistic recombination rates\n",
    "- **Inter-Chromosome Recombination**: Sets a high recombination rate (log(2)) between chromosomes to ensure independence\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Pedigree Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pedigree Loading**: Reads a family structure from a tab-delimited file (`pedigree.fam`)\n",
    "- **Generation Assignment**: Automatically determines generational relationships among individuals\n",
    "- **Pedigree Visualization**: Creates network diagrams of the family tree structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Simulation Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Pedigree**: Creates a fixed pedigree structure in `msprime`\n",
    "2. **Generate Tree Sequences**: Simulates genetic inheritance through the pedigree\n",
    "3. **Add Mutations**: Applies mutations using specified mutation rates\n",
    "4. **Extract IBD Segments**: Identifies segments shared between individuals that are identical by descent\n",
    "5. **Calculate MRCAs**: Determines the most recent common ancestor for each pair of individuals\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Output Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tree Sequence Files**: Saves the raw simulation data as `.trees` files\n",
    "- **IBD Segment Data**: Creates CSV files with detailed information about IBD segments\n",
    "- **MRCA Information**: Generates comprehensive pairwise MRCA data\n",
    "- **VCF Generation**: Converts simulations to Variant Call Format (VCF) files for compatibility with genetic analysis tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Functions Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### `build_rate_map()`\n",
    "Creates a genetic recombination map integrating multiple chromosomes into a single continuous sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `assign_generations()`\n",
    "Analyzes a pedigree to determine which generation each individual belongs to, working through parent-child relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `add_individuals_to_pedigree()`\n",
    "Constructs the `msprime` pedigree structure by adding individuals with their appropriate parent relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `extract_ibd_segments()`\n",
    "Identifies segments of DNA shared between individuals that are identical by descent, considering minimum length thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `calculate_comprehensive_pairwise_mrca()`\n",
    "For each pair of individuals, determines all distinct most recent common ancestors and the genomic regions each MRCA is responsible for.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `process_tree_sequence()`\n",
    "Integrated function that processes a tree sequence to extract genetic information, IBD segments, and MRCA calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Chromosome Modeling**: Creates a continuous sequence with high recombination \"breaks\" between chromosomes\n",
    "- **IBD Segment Tracking**: Uses interval trees to efficiently track overlapping genomic segments\n",
    "- **Position Mapping**: Maintains mappings between continuous simulation coordinates and chromosome-specific coordinates\n",
    "- **Parallelization**: Runs multiple independent replicates of the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is valuable for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Genetic Genealogy Research**: Modeling how DNA segments are inherited through generations\n",
    "2. **IBD Pattern Analysis**: Studying patterns of genetic sharing between relatives\n",
    "3. **Algorithm Validation**: Testing methods for relationship prediction from genetic data\n",
    "4. **Educational Purposes**: Demonstrating principles of genetic inheritance in complex pedigrees\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary outputs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IBD Segment Files**: Data on which genomic segments are shared between which individuals\n",
    "- **MRCA Data**: Information about the common ancestors responsible for each shared segment\n",
    "- **VCF Files**: Genetic variant data in standard format for further analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "These outputs can be used to analyze relationships between genetic sharing patterns and genealogical relationships, particularly for validating methods that predict relationships from observed IBD patterns."

    "# Introduction to Tree Sequences (ts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree sequences are a powerful data structure developed for efficient storage and analysis of genetic ancestry information. They were developed as part of the [tskit](https://tskit.dev/) project to address computational challenges in population genetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Tree Sequence?\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree sequence is a compact representation of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ancestral Relationships**: The genealogical trees that relate individuals across different segments of the genome\n",
    "2. **Genetic Variation**: The mutations that occurred along these ancestral lineages\n",
    "3. **Genomic Locations**: The specific positions where recombination changes the ancestry pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storage Efficiency**: Tree sequences can store complete evolutionary histories in a fraction of the space compared to traditional formats\n",
    "- **Computational Speed**: Many population genetic analyses can be performed orders of magnitude faster\n",
    "- **Lossless Compression**: Complete genealogical information is preserved, allowing exact reconstruction of genetic data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tskit\n",

    "# Predicting Degrees of Relatedness and TMRCA Using Segment Sharing Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Machine Learning Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "When predicting multiple dependent variables (degrees of relatedness and TMRCA) based on segment sharing parameters, you need a robust machine learning approach that can handle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple Input Features** (segment sharing parameters):\n",
    "   * Number of shared segments\n",
    "   * Total shared length (cM)\n",
    "   * Length of longest segment\n",
    "   * Average segment length\n",
    "   * Distribution of segment lengths\n",
    "   * Chromosomal locations of segments\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Output Variables** (what you want to predict):\n",
    "   * Degree of relatedness\n",
    "   * TMRCA (Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why XGBoost Is Appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an excellent choice for this problem because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Superior Performance**: XGBoost consistently outperforms other algorithms on structured/tabular data problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handles Non-linear Relationships**: The relationship between genetic sharing parameters and relatedness is complex and non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Importance**: XGBoost provides insights into which segment parameters are most predictive of relatedness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handles Missing Data**: Can work with incomplete genetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multi-output Capability**: Can be configured for multi-target regression to predict both degree of relatedness and TMRCA simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Basic implementation structure\n",
    "import xgboost as xgb\n",
    "from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputRegressor\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prepare your data\n",
    "X = df[['num_segments', 'total_cm', 'longest_segment', 'avg_segment_length', ...]]\n",
    "y = df[['degree_of_relatedness', 'tmrca_years']]\n",
    "\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multi-output regression with XGBoost\n",
    "xgb_model = xgb.XGBRegressor(\n",
    "    objective='reg:squarederror',\n",
    "    n_estimators=100,\n",
    "    max_depth=4,\n",
    "    learning_rate=0.1\n",
    ")\n",
    "multi_output_model = MultiOutputRegressor(xgb_model)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train the model\n",
    "multi_output_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make predictions\n",
    "predictions = multi_output_model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternatives to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Forests**: Another ensemble method that works well for this type of problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Neural Networks**: Deep learning approaches for more complex pattern recognition if you have sufficient data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bayesian Models**: When you want to incorporate prior knowledge about genetic inheritance patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "For this specific problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: For continuous predictions like TMRCA\n",
    "* **Classification Metrics**: For discretized relationship categories\n",
    "* **Calibration Plots**: To assess probability estimates of different relationship degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of XGBoost or similar ensemble methods provides the right balance of predictive power and interpretability needed for genetic relationship inference."

    "# Inverse Genetic Relationship Inference: Two Directions of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Direction 1: From Known Relationship to Probable IBD Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "When you know the genealogical relationship (generation of ancestor or degree of relatedness), predicting the probable IBD sharing pattern is a **forward probability problem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Known Relationship \u2192 Probable IBD Sharing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probabilistic Distribution**: For any known relationship (e.g., first cousins), there exists a **distribution** of possible IBD sharing values, not a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Theoretical Foundation**: This direction is well-supported by genetic theory. We can calculate expected values:\n",
    "   * First cousins share ~12.5% of their DNA on average\n",
    "   * Second cousins share ~3.125% on average\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variations Around the Mean**: Due to recombination randomness, actual sharing can vary significantly:\n",
    "   * First cousins might share anywhere from ~7-14% of their DNA\n",
    "   * Second cousins might share ~1-5%\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **More Predictable for Closer Relations**: The distribution is tighter for closer relationships, becoming much wider for distant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mathematical Models**: This direction uses probability theory and can be modeled with binomial or normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Direction 2: From Observed IBD Sharing to Inferring Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "When you observe IBD sharing patterns and want to infer the genealogical relationship, you're solving an **inverse probability problem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Observed IBD Sharing \u2192 Inferred Relationship\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple Possible Explanations**: A specific amount of shared DNA could indicate several different possible relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bayesian Inference Required**: Must consider prior probabilities of different relationships in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overlapping Distributions**: The sharing distributions for adjacent relationship degrees overlap significantly:\n",
    "   * 5% shared DNA could indicate 2nd cousins, 1st cousins twice removed, half 1st cousins, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **More Features Improve Accuracy**: Using multiple parameters improves discrimination:\n",
    "   * Total shared cM\n",
    "   * Number of segments\n",
    "   * Length distribution of segments\n",
    "   * Longest segment\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Machine Learning Approach**: This direction typically requires supervised learning algorithms (like XGBoost) to handle the complex, overlapping distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why These Directions Are Different\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Asymmetry**: The probability P(IBD | Relationship) is not the same as P(Relationship | IBD).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Information Content**: Known relationships provide more constraint than observed IBD patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Uncertainty Scale**: Relationship inference generally has higher uncertainty than IBD prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Required Methods**: \n",
    "   * Direction 1 (Relationship \u2192 IBD): Can use direct probability calculations\n",
    "   * Direction 2 (IBD \u2192 Relationship): Requires more complex statistical/ML approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Real-world Applications**:\n",
    "   * Direction 1: Used in simulations, genetic counseling, and theoretical work\n",
    "   * Direction 2: Used in consumer genetic testing, unknown parentage cases, and genetic genealogy\n",
    "\n",
    "This fundamental asymmetry explains why inferring relationships from genetic sharing is more challenging than predicting sharing patterns from known relationships, and why sophisticated machine learning approaches like XGBoost are particularly valuable for the relationship inference direction."

    "# Understanding the stdpopsim Warning Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "When running the msprime simulation script, you might encounter warning messages similar to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "FutureWarning: Calling int on a single element Series is deprecated and will raise a TypeError in the future. Use int(ser.iloc[0]) instead\n",
    "  time=int(extended_GF.time.head(1) - 1), rate=0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What These Warnings Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "These are `FutureWarning` messages from the pandas library, which is used by the stdpopsim package. They indicate that the code is using a deprecated method that will be removed in future versions of pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the warnings are about:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Converting a pandas Series with a single value to an integer using `int(series)` \n",
    "2. The recommended approach is to use `int(series.iloc[0])` instead\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why You're Seeing These Warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "The warnings are coming from the demographic models in the stdpopsim package (version 0.2.0), specifically in the HomSap/demographic_models.py file. This is not an issue with your simulation script but with the library it depends on.\n",
    "\n",
    "These warnings appear when:\n",
    "- The script loads the demographic model using `species.get_demographic_model(\"AmericanAdmixture_4B11\")`\n",
    "- The demographic model code uses pandas to process timing information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Impact on Your Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that these warnings:\n",
    "- Don't affect the correctness of your simulation results\n",
    "- Don't cause the script to crash or fail\n",
    "- Are purely informational about future compatibility issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find the warnings distracting, you have several options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Suppress the warnings in your script**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import warnings\n",
    "   warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=FutureWarning)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Update the stdpopsim package** (if a newer version is available):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install --upgrade stdpopsim\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   or\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   poetry update stdpopsim\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a local patch** for the stdpopsim library if you have the technical skills and need to fix it immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Report the issue** to the stdpopsim developers on their GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "For most users, simply ignoring these warnings is reasonable as they don't affect simulation results. If you're developing code that others will use, consider adding a warning filter to prevent confusion."
