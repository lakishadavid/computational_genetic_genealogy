   "source": "## Summary\n\nIn this lab, we explored how Bonsai v3 connects individuals into small pedigree structures. We examined the actual Bonsai v3 implementations of key functions before providing simplified versions for educational purposes. Key takeaways include:\n\n1. **Understanding Bonsai's Core Functions**: We examined the source code of critical Bonsai v3 functions like `get_possible_connection_point_set`, `add_parent`, `connect_pedigrees_through_points`, and `get_ped_like` to understand how Bonsai builds and evaluates pedigrees.\n\n2. **Building Blocks**: We learned how to create basic pedigree structures like parent-child units, sibling groups, and half-sibling structures, which form the building blocks of more complex pedigrees.\n\n3. **Connection Points**: We identified potential connection points within pedigrees using Bonsai's `get_possible_connection_point_set` function, which represents positions where different pedigrees can be joined together.\n\n4. **Connecting Pedigrees**: We implemented simplified versions of Bonsai's pedigree connection functions to connect two pedigrees based on specified connection points, considering different types of connections (upward, downward, or lateral).\n\n5. **Evaluating Structures**: We created simplified methods based on Bonsai's likelihood evaluation system to evaluate how well different pedigree structures explain observed IBD data, allowing us to select the most likely structure.\n\n6. **Alternative Hypotheses**: We compared different pedigree hypotheses by evaluating their log-likelihood scores and consistency with the observed genetic data, similar to how Bonsai compares alternative pedigree configurations.\n\nThese techniques form the foundation of Bonsai's approach to pedigree reconstruction. By connecting small structures based on genetic evidence and evaluating alternative hypotheses, Bonsai builds cohesive pedigrees that best explain the observed patterns of DNA sharing. The simplified implementations we've created in this lab help illustrate the core principles while being compatible with JupyterLite, though they lack some of the sophisticated optimizations and statistical models found in the full Bonsai v3 codebase.",
