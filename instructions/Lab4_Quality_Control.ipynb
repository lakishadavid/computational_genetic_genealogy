    "# Genetic Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic maps, also known as recombination maps, are essential tools that illustrate the relative positions of genetic markers (such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) along a chromosome. Unlike physical maps that measure distances in base pairs, genetic maps measure distances in centiMorgans (cM), where one centiMorgan represents a 1% probability of recombination between markers during meiosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components of Genetic Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Markers:**  \n",
    "  Identifiable DNA sequences used as reference points on the genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recombination Frequency:**  \n",
    "  The probability of a recombination event occurring between markers, which informs the genetic distances.\n",

    "## BEAGLE's Genetic Map\n",
    "\n",
    "BEAGLE is a widely used software package for phasing, genotype imputation, and identity-by-descent (IBD) analysis. Its performance is closely tied to the use of high-resolution genetic maps. Here are some distinctive features of BEAGLE's genetic map:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Marker Density:**  \n",
    "  The genetic maps provided with BEAGLE include a dense array of markers. This density allows for the precise capture of fine-scale recombination events, which in turn improves the accuracy of haplotype phasing and genotype imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Species and Population Specificity:**  \n",
    "  The maps are often developed from extensive pedigree or population studies. For human genetic studies, they are constructed based on large-scale recombination data, ensuring relevance to the population under study.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integration with Statistical Models:**  \n",
    "  BEAGLE utilizes these maps within its statistical algorithms to model recombination events effectively. This integration is crucial for accurately inferring missing genotypes and detecting IBD segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Analysis Accuracy:**  \n",
    "  The detailed recombination information in BEAGLE's genetic maps allows for better adjustment for linkage disequilibrium and recombination rates, ultimately leading to more robust downstream genetic analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Using BEAGLE's Genetic Map\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Phasing Accuracy:**  \n",
    "  The high-resolution data facilitates precise haplotype reconstruction, reducing errors in phase determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robust Genotype Imputation:**  \n",
    "  Detailed recombination rate data enhances the accuracy of imputing missing genotypes, ensuring more reliable datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Streamlined Analysis Workflow:**  \n",
    "  The genetic map is specifically tailored to integrate seamlessly with BEAGLE’s algorithms, thereby optimizing the overall analysis process.\n",

The pipeline integrates several tools (e.g., PLINK2, bcftools, Beagle) to perform quality control, filtering, and conversion of VCF files into other formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline performs the following major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quality Control Filtering:**  \n",
    "   Applies a series of default QC filters to the VCF file:\n",
    "   - **Autosomal Filtering:** Only autosomal SNPs are retained (excludes X and Y chromosomes to simplify analysis).\n",
    "   - **Duplicate Removal:** Duplicated SNPs are removed (keeps the first occurrence).\n",
    "   - **VCF Half-Call Handling:** Half-calls are treated as missing.\n",
    "   - **SNP Filtering:** Keeps only SNPs with nucleotide calls in {A, C, G, T} (ignoring case).\n",
    "   - **Biallelic SNPs:** Filters for SNPs with exactly two alleles.\n",
    "   - **Genotype Missingness (`--geno`):** Excludes SNPs with a missingness rate exceeding the specified threshold.\n",
    "   - **Minor Allele Frequency (`--maf`):** Excludes SNPs with a frequency lower than the specified threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation and Dependency Checks:**  \n",
    "   - Validates the merged VCF file by counting samples, SNPs, and verifying chromosome headers.\n",
    "   - Checks that required tools (e.g., `bcftools`, `bgzip`, `plink2`) are installed and attempts to install missing components like the Beagle JAR dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sex Determination Processing:**  \n",
    "   - Parses input files containing sex determination results.\n",
    "   - Writes PLINK2-compatible sex files (including `.psam` and sex update files) for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Conversion and Filtering:**  \n",
    "   - **Step 1:** Converts the VCF file into PLINK format using `plink2` with QC parameters.\n",
    "   - **Step 2:** Filters the PLINK data by genotype missingness and minor allele frequency.\n",
    "   - **Step 3:** Splits the dataset by chromosome and exports each chromosome’s data as a VCF file.  \n",
    "     This step also includes filtering for biallelic variants, compressing, and indexing the output VCF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Processing Special Chromosomes:**  \n",
    "   - Dedicated routines handle chromosomes X, Y, and MT (mitochondrial) separately, as they may require additional processing (e.g., PAR splitting for chromosome X).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Phasing:**  \n",
    "   - After QC and filtering, the script calls an external shell script (`phase_chromosomes.sh`) to phase chromosomes using Beagle.  \n",
    "   - The script passes an input file prefix (derived from the processed VCF file) along with directory paths and the Beagle JAR file for further phasing operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Logging and Error Handling:**  \n",
    "   - A robust logging mechanism is set up to capture both console and file outputs, enabling detailed tracking of the pipeline’s progress and errors.\n",
    "   - The script employs exception handling to catch failures at different steps, ensuring the pipeline stops if critical issues are detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Functions and Their Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`configure_logging()`**  \n",
    "  Sets up file and console logging with configurable debug levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`parse_arguments()`**  \n",
    "  Parses command-line arguments to customize parameters such as the input VCF file, QC thresholds, and sex determination files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`check_dependencies()`**  \n",
    "  Verifies that external tools (`bcftools`, `bgzip`, `plink2`) are available. It dynamically locates (or installs) the Beagle JAR file if it is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`validate_merged_vcf()` and `validate_vcf()`**  \n",
    "  Validate the input VCF file by:\n",
    "  - Counting the number of samples and SNPs.\n",
    "  - Extracting and comparing chromosome lists from the VCF header and the CHROM field.\n",
    "  - Extracting sample IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`parse_sex_determination()` and `write_sex_files()`**  \n",
    "  Process sex determination outputs to generate files compatible with PLINK2, ensuring that downstream analyses correctly interpret the sex of each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conversion and Filtering Steps (`step_1_convert_vcf_to_plink()`, `step_2_filter_genotype_and_maf()`, `step_3_split_by_chromosome()`)**  \n",
    "  Convert VCF data to PLINK format and apply additional QC filters. The pipeline then splits the data by chromosome and generates per-chromosome VCF outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Special Chromosome Processing (`step_process_X()`, `step_process_Y()`, `step_process_MT()`)**  \n",
    "  Handle conversion, filtering, and exporting for chromosomes X, Y, and MT. Each function is tailored to address the unique challenges associated with these chromosomes (e.g., sex update for chromosome X).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`run_command()`**  \n",
    "  A helper function to execute shell commands, suppressing or capturing output as necessary, with error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`main()`**  \n",
    "  The main entry point that ties all the steps together. It orchestrates:\n",
    "  - Validation of the VCF file.\n",
    "  - QC and filtering processes.\n",
    "  - Dependency checks and installation steps.\n",
    "  - Execution of the phasing script.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the script using Poetry, one might call:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry run python -m scripts_work.quality_control_vcf \\\n",
    "    --vcf_file data/open_snps_data/opensnps.vcf.gz \\\n",
    "    --determined_sex_file data/open_snps_data/determined_sex.txt \\\n",
    "    --failed_sex data/open_snps_data/failed_sex.txt \\\n",
    "    --geno 0.05 --maf 0.05\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command initiates the QC pipeline with specified thresholds for genotype missingness (--geno) and minor allele frequency (--maf), along with input files for VCF and sex determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This pipeline is designed to provide a robust, modular framework for processing VCF files in genetic studies. By integrating multiple tools and configurable QC parameters, it balances stringency and flexibility, ensuring a high-quality dataset for downstream analyses in genetic genealogy and population genetics."
