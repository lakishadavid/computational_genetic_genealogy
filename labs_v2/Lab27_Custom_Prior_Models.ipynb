    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores custom prior probability models in Bonsai v3, which are implemented in the `prior.py` module. Prior probability models allow you to incorporate prior knowledge and population-specific information into the pedigree reconstruction process, enhancing the accuracy of genetic relationship inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the role of prior probabilities in Bayesian inference for genetic genealogy\n",
    "- Explore the structure and implementation of the `prior.py` module in Bonsai v3\n",
    "- Learn how to develop and customize prior probability models for different populations\n",
    "- Apply custom priors to improve relationship inference accuracy\n",
    "- Evaluate the impact of different prior models on reconstruction results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- Completion of Lab 6: Probabilistic Relationship Inference\n",
    "- Completion of Lab 7: PwLogLike Class\n",
    "- Basic understanding of Bayesian statistics\n",

For example, we might know that parent-child relationships are more common than second-cousin relationships in our dataset, or that certain age differences make some relationships more likely than others. Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for incorporating this prior knowledge into relationship inference.\n",

    "## Part 1: The Role of Prior Probabilities in Bonsai v3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonsai v3 uses a Bayesian inference framework to deduce the most likely relationships between individuals based on their shared IBD (Identity by Descent) segments. In Bayesian inference, we aim to calculate the posterior probability of a relationship $R$ given the observed genetic data $D$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(R|D) = \\frac{P(D|R) \\times P(R)}{P(D)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $P(R|D)$ is the posterior probability of relationship $R$ given the genetic data $D$\n",
    "- $P(D|R)$ is the likelihood of observing the genetic data $D$ if the relationship is $R$\n",
    "- $P(R)$ is the prior probability of relationship $R$ before seeing any genetic data\n",
    "- $P(D)$ is the marginal likelihood of the data (a normalization constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "The prior probability $P(R)$ represents our beliefs about the relative frequencies of different relationships before examining the genetic evidence. Well-designed priors can significantly improve relationship inference, especially when the genetic evidence is limited or ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bonsai v3, the prior probability model fulfills several key roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relationship Priors**: Specifying the expected frequencies of different relationship types in the population\n",
    "2. **Age-Based Priors**: Incorporating constraints based on age differences between individuals\n",
    "3. **Population-Specific Priors**: Adapting priors to reflect the demographic characteristics of specific populations\n",
    "4. **External Knowledge Integration**: Incorporating non-genetic information into the inference process\n",
    "\n",
    "The `prior.py` module in Bonsai v3 provides functions to calculate these prior probabilities, which are then combined with genetic likelihood models to determine the most probable relationships."

    "As we can see from the visualizations, population size plays a crucial role in determining the probability of shared ancestry and IBD segment sharing. In smaller populations, the likelihood of two randomly selected individuals sharing a common ancestor in the recent past is much higher than in larger populations. This has important implications for genealogical research in different demographic contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Small, Isolated Populations**: Higher rates of shared ancestry and IBD segment sharing are expected, requiring adjusted priors to avoid overestimating close relationships.\n",

    "Relationship prior probabilities represent our expectations about the relative frequencies of different relationship types in a population before considering any genetic evidence. In genetic genealogy, relationships are often parameterized using a tuple representation (up, down, num_ancs) where:\n",

    "- `down`: Number of generations from the common ancestor down to the second individual\n",

    "- Parent-child: (1, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 1)\n",
    "- Full siblings: (1, 1, 2)\n",
    "- Half siblings: (1, 1, 1)\n",
    "- First cousins: (2, 2, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship prior model assigns probabilities to these different relationship types, typically based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Demographic Patterns**: Age structure, marriage patterns, and fertility rates in the population\n",
    "2. **Genealogical Structure**: Typical family structures in the culture or time period\n",
    "3. **Study Design**: The sampling approach used to collect genetic data\n",

    "As demonstrated in the comparison, population demographics significantly impact the relationship prior probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Large, Diverse Populations**:\n",
    "   - Higher probability of close relationships like parent-child and siblings\n",
    "   - Lower probability of distant relationships like cousins\n",
    "   - Reflect the lower background IBD sharing in large populations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Endogamous Populations**:\n",
    "   - Relatively lower probability of immediate family relationships\n",
    "   - Higher probability of cousin and distant relationships\n",
    "   - Account for the elevated background IBD sharing due to population structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Tailoring the prior model to the specific population context can significantly improve the accuracy of relationship inference, especially in populations with unusual demographic histories or marriage patterns."

    "### Self-Assessment Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does the expected number of common ancestors change with population size?\n",
    "   * Answer: The expected number of common ancestors decreases as population size increases. In smaller populations, two individuals are more likely to share common ancestors in the recent past.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why is it important to adjust prior models for different population demographics?\n",
    "   * Answer: Different populations have different expected frequencies of relationship types. Using an inappropriate prior model can lead to systematic biases in relationship inference, especially in populations with unusual demographic histories or marriage patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How does the minimum detectable segment length affect the relationship prior model?\n",
    "   * Answer: A smaller minimum segment length allows detection of more distant relationships, which shifts the prior probability distribution toward more distant relationships. Conversely, a larger minimum segment length means fewer distant relationships can be detected, shifting the prior distribution toward closer relationships."
