    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we explored how Bonsai v3 finds and uses optimal connection points to merge separate pedigrees into larger structures. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connection Points**: Positions within pedigrees where they can be connected to other pedigrees, represented as tuples of (id, parent_id, direction).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Restricting Connection Points**: Bonsai v3 intelligently restricts the search space by focusing on connection points involving individuals who share IBD.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluating Connections**: Different relationship configurations are evaluated based on IBD sharing patterns, demographic constraints, and other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Physical Merging**: Once optimal connection points and relationship configurations are identified, pedigrees are physically merged through these points.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multiple Hypotheses**: Bonsai v3 maintains multiple alternative pedigree configurations, ranked by their likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is essential for reconstructing large family networks from genetic data, as it determines how smaller family units connect to form larger genealogies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts and techniques explored in this lab build on the foundation established in Lab 15 (Combine Up Dicts) and are essential for understanding how Bonsai v3 scales to larger and more complex pedigrees."
