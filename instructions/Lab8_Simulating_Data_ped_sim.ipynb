    "In the updated relationships dataframe, each row represents an unique pair. It also has the total number of segments shared in the pair, total amount of DNA (minimum of 3 cM), and largest 4 segment (cM). You'll also see a genealogical_relationship column where the value is a tuple. In the tuple, the first value is the number of generations from id1 to the shared ancestor, and the second value is the number of generations from id2 and the shared ancestor. For example, (2, 1) means that there is 2 generations between id1 and the shared ancestor and 1 generation between id2 and the shared ancestor. A genealogical_relationship of (1, 1) is full siblings (i.e., siblings sharing both biological parents). A value of 0 means \"self\", indicating that self is the ancestor of the other person. For example, (0, 1) means that id1 is the parent of id2. In another example, (2, 0) means that id1 is the grandchild of id2."
