            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p><strong>Core Component:</strong> This lab explores Bonsai v3's algorithms for identifying potential connection points between individuals or pedigrees. Finding optimal ways to connect individuals based on genetic evidence is a central challenge in computational genetic genealogy, and understanding these algorithms is essential for comprehending how Bonsai reconstructs complex family trees.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Connection Point Problem</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Defining Connection Points</h4>
                <p>In genetic genealogy, we often encounter situations where we have evidence that two individuals or pedigrees are related, but we need to determine precisely how they connect. This is the "connection point problem," and it's central to Bonsai v3's pedigree construction algorithm.</p>
                
                <p>A connection point in Bonsai v3 is represented as a tuple of the form <code>(id1, id2, dir)</code>, where:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>id1:</strong> The primary individual through which the connection is made</li>
                    <li><strong>id2:</strong> An optional secondary individual (usually a partner of id1)</li>
                    <li><strong>dir:</strong> The direction of the connection
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>0</code>: Connect downward from the node (add as child)</li>
                            <li><code>1</code>: Connect upward from the node (add as parent)</li>
                            <li><code>None</code>: Replace the node or connect laterally</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This tuple representation encapsulates three key aspects of a potential connection:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Who</strong> is being connected (the individuals involved)</li>
                    <li><strong>How</strong> they're being connected (the direction of the connection)</li>
                    <li><strong>What</strong> type of relationship is being created (implicitly through the direction)</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>The connection point approach is powerful because it allows Bonsai to systematically evaluate all possible ways that two pedigree fragments might be connected, and to prioritize the most likely connections based on genetic evidence.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Types of Connection Points</h4>
                <p>There are three primary types of connection points in Bonsai v3, each representing a different way to connect individuals or pedigrees:</p>
                
                <div class="connection-types">
                    <div class="connection-type">
                        <h5>Upward Connections (<code>dir=1</code>)</h5>
                        <p>An upward connection adds a parent to an individual. This is appropriate when genetic evidence suggests that an individual from one pedigree is descended from someone in the other pedigree.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Adding a previously unknown parent to an individual who was thought to be a founder.</p>
                        <pre><code>// Upward connection (id, None, 1)
// Before:     After:
//   1           1
//  / \         / \
// 2   3       2   3
//               \
//                4</code></pre>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="connection-type">
                        <h5>Downward Connections (<code>dir=0</code>)</h5>
                        <p>A downward connection adds a child to an individual or couple. This is appropriate when the evidence suggests that someone in one pedigree is an ancestor of someone in the other pedigree.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Identifying that a couple had an additional child who's the ancestor of individuals in another pedigree.</p>
                        <pre><code>// Downward connection (id1, id2, 0)
// Before:        After:
//    1   2         1   2
//     \ /           \ /
//      3             3
//                    |
//                    4</code></pre>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="connection-type">
                        <h5>Lateral/Replace Connections (<code>dir=None</code>)</h5>
                        <p>A lateral connection either replaces an individual or connects individuals at the same generation level. This is appropriate when the evidence suggests that individuals previously thought to be unrelated are actually the same person or are related laterally (e.g., as siblings).</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Discovering that an individual appears in two different pedigrees under different identities.</p>
                        <pre><code>// Replace connection (id, None, None)
// Before:     After:
//   1           1
//  / \         / \
// 2   3       X   3
//                 |
//                 4</code></pre>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>In the actual implementation, Bonsai v3 uses sophisticated algorithms to identify all possible connection points of these types in a pedigree. The core function for this purpose is <code>get_possible_connection_point_set()</code>:</p>

    return point_set</code></pre>
                
                <p>This function systematically evaluates every individual in the pedigree, considering:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Whether they can have additional parents added (upward connection)</li>
                    <li>Whether they can have children added, either alone or with a partner (downward connection)</li>
                    <li>Whether they can be replaced or connected laterally (replace/lateral connection)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The result is a comprehensive set of all possible ways the pedigree could be connected to another pedigree, which forms the foundation for the next step: prioritizing the most likely connections based on genetic evidence.</p>

            <div class="concept-section">
                <h4>Finding Partners for Connection Points</h4>
                <p>Many connection points involve couples rather than single individuals, so Bonsai v3 needs to identify the partners of each individual in the pedigree. This is accomplished through the <code>get_partner_id_set()</code> function:</p>
                
                <pre><code>def get_partner_id_set(node, up_dct):

        node: Individual ID
        up_dct: Up-node dictionary representing the pedigree
        
    Returns:
        Set of partner IDs
    """
    # Convert to down-node dictionary to find children
    down_dct = reverse_node_dict(up_dct)
    
    # Get children of the node (direct descendants only)
    child_id_set = {c for c, d in down_dct.get(node, {}).items() if d == 1}
    
    # For each child, find the other parent(s)
    partner_id_set = set()
    for cid in child_id_set:
        # Get all direct parents of this child
        parent_ids = {p for p, d in up_dct.get(cid, {}).items() if d == 1}
        # Add them to the partner set
        partner_id_set.update(parent_ids)
    
    # Remove the node itself from the partner set
    partner_id_set.discard(node)
    
    return partner_id_set</code></pre>
                
                <p>This function works by first finding all children of the individual, then for each child, identifying all parents. Any parent other than the individual themselves is considered a partner. This approach handles complex scenarios like:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple marriages/partnerships</li>
                    <li>Blended families</li>
                    <li>Cases where an individual has children with multiple partners</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>By accurately identifying partners, Bonsai can generate connection points that respect the full complexity of human family structures.</p>

                <h4>Restricting Connection Points Based on IBD</h4>
                <p>When we have genetic evidence like IBD (Identity by Descent) sharing, we can often restrict the set of possible connection points to those that could explain the observed patterns. Bonsai v3 implements this through the <code>restrict_connection_point_set()</code> function:</p>
                
                <pre><code>def restrict_connection_point_set(up_dct, con_pt_set, id_set):

        con_pt_set: Set of all possible connection points
        id_set: Set of individual IDs that share IBD with another pedigree
        
    Returns:
        Restricted set of connection points

    # Get all IDs in the subtree
    sub_id_set = set(sub_dct.keys())

        if a in sub_id_set or (b is not None and b in sub_id_set):
            restricted_con_pt_set.add((a, b, d))
    
    return restricted_con_pt_set</code></pre>
                
                <p>This function works by:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Finding the minimal subtree containing all individuals that share IBD</li>
                    <li>Restricting connection points to those involving individuals in this subtree</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>The key insight is that if two pedigrees share IBD, the connection between them must involve the ancestors of the individuals showing the IBD sharing. By focusing on this subtree, Bonsai dramatically reduces the search space while ensuring no valid connection points are overlooked.</p>

                <h4>Evaluating Connection Quality</h4>
                <p>After implementing a connection, Bonsai v3 needs to evaluate how well it explains the observed genetic data. This evaluation is based on a comprehensive model of genetic inheritance, taking into account factors like:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IBD Sharing Consistency:</strong> Whether the observed IBD sharing matches what would be expected given the relationship</li>
                    <li><strong>Genetic Recombination:</strong> Whether the observed patterns of recombination are consistent with the proposed relationship</li>
                    <li><strong>Age Consistency:</strong> Whether the proposed connections respect biological constraints on parent-child age differences</li>
                    <li><strong>Demographic Plausibility:</strong> Whether the proposed connections are demographically plausible given historical context</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>In the production implementation, this evaluation uses sophisticated statistical models based on Mendelian inheritance and population genetics. A simplified version of the evaluation function looks like this:</p>
                
                <pre><code>def evaluate_connection(combined_pedigree, id_to_shared_ibd):
    """Evaluate a connected pedigree based on how well it explains IBD sharing.

        id_to_shared_ibd: Dict mapping individual IDs to the amount of IBD they share
        
    Returns:
        score: A score indicating how well the pedigree explains the IBD sharing
    """
    # Calculate relationships in the combined pedigree
    rel_dict = get_rel_dict(combined_pedigree)
    
    # Compute correlation between relationship degrees and IBD sharing

    # For each individual, calculate expected IBD sharing
    expected_ibd = {}
    for i in individuals:
        expected_ibd[i] = 0.0
        
        for j, rel_tuple in rel_dict.get(i, {}).items():
            if j not in id_to_shared_ibd or rel_tuple is None:
                continue
                
            # Calculate expected sharing based on relationship
            up, down, num_ancs = rel_tuple
            degree = up + down
            expected_coef = num_ancs * (0.5 ** degree) if degree > 0 else 1.0
                
            # Add to expected IBD
            expected_ibd[i] += expected_coef * id_to_shared_ibd[j]
    
    # Calculate correlation between expected and observed IBD
    observed = [id_to_shared_ibd[i] for i in individuals]
    expected = [expected_ibd[i] for i in individuals]
    
    # Return correlation coefficient
    return np.corrcoef(observed, expected)[0, 1]</code></pre>
                
                <p>This function evaluates a connection by comparing the observed IBD sharing with what would be expected given the relationships in the combined pedigree. Higher correlation scores indicate better consistency between the genetic evidence and the proposed connections.</p>
                
                <p>In practice, Bonsai will evaluate multiple potential connections and select the one with the highest score, or in some cases, present multiple high-scoring alternatives for human review.</p>

                <p><strong>Core Component:</strong> Finding connection points is a foundational operation in Bonsai v3's pedigree construction algorithm.

            <h3>Comparing Notebook and Production Code</h3>
            
            <p>The Lab11 notebook provides a simplified exploration of connection point algorithms, while the production implementation in Bonsai v3 includes additional sophistication:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance Optimizations:</strong> The production code includes sophisticated caching and pruning strategies to handle large pedigrees efficiently</li>
                <li><strong>Probabilistic Models:</strong> More advanced statistical models for scoring connection points that account for IBD length distributions and population-specific parameters</li>
                <li><strong>Cycle Detection:</strong> Robust handling of potential cycles in pedigrees that could arise from certain connection patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-way Connections:</strong> Support for connecting more than two pedigrees simultaneously in complex scenarios</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Resolution:</strong> Sophisticated algorithms for determining when individuals in different pedigrees might actually be the same person</li>
                <li><strong>User Interaction:</strong> Support for incorporating user feedback and constraints on connection points</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The notebook provides a valuable introduction to the key concepts, but the production implementation represents years of refinement to handle the complexities of real-world genetic data and pedigree structures.</p>

<h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
            <p>As you explore connection point algorithms, consider these broader implications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genealogical Research:</strong> How computational methods are transforming traditional genealogical research by identifying connections that might be missed through documentary evidence alone</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> The implications of discovering unexpected connections between families, and how to handle sensitive information</li>
                <li><strong>Historical Applications:</strong> How these algorithms can help reconstruct historical population structures from fragmentary genetic and documentary evidence</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy and Consent:</strong> The importance of informed consent when inferring connections between individuals, especially for living people</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These considerations highlight how connection point algorithms are not just technical solutions but tools with significant implications for understanding human history, identity, and relatedness.</p>
