    "\n",
    "In this lab, we've explored how Bonsai v3 incorporates age information to enhance relationship inference:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Age Difference Distributions**: We examined the statistical distributions of age differences for various relationships, represented by normal distributions with characteristic means and standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Age-Based Likelihood Calculation**: We explored how Bonsai computes likelihood scores based on age differences using the actual code from the `likelihoods.py` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combining Evidence**: We saw how the `PwLogLike` class integrates genetic and age-based evidence to get more accurate relationship inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Relationship Disambiguation**: We demonstrated how age information can disambiguate between genetically similar relationships, such as half-siblings, grandparent-grandchild, and avuncular relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Age Moments Data Format**: We examined the structure of Bonsai's age moments data and how it's stored and retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Custom Age Models**: We learned how to create custom age models with different parameters for specific populations or use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration of demographic information with genetic evidence is a powerful approach that makes Bonsai v3 more accurate in real-world relationship inference and pedigree reconstruction."
