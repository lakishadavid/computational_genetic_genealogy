                <dt><strong>Genetic Ancestry Components</strong></dt>
                <dd>A more contemporary approach replacing the term "admixture." This concept recognizes that all human populations share common ancestry and have experienced ongoing genetic exchange throughout history. Rather than viewing populations as discrete entities that "mix," this framework acknowledges the continuous nature of human genetic variation and the artificial nature of population boundaries. All humans possess diverse genetic ancestry components reflecting our shared evolutionary history and complex patterns of migration, interaction, and relationship building.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>Ancestry-Informed Analysis</strong></dt>
                <dd>An approach that uses patterns of genetic variation to identify genomic regions associated with traits or diseases that show frequency differences across geographic regions, without relying on discrete population categories. This approach acknowledges that genetic ancestry exists along continua rather than as discrete categories.</dd>

                <dt><strong>Genetic Genealogy</strong></dt>

                <dt><strong>Hidden Markov Model (HMM)</strong></dt>
                <dd>A statistical model used in IBD detection algorithms like IBIS to infer the hidden state (IBD/not-IBD) from observed genetic data.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>Pedigree Reconstruction</strong></dt>
                <dd>The computational process of inferring family relationships and structures based solely on genetic data, without prior genealogical information.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>Population Structure</strong></dt>
                <dd>The organization of genetic variation within and between populations, often visualized using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>Positional Burrows-Wheeler Transform (PBWT)</strong></dt>
                <dd>An algorithm used in Hap-IBD for efficient detection of identical haplotype segments between individuals.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>Precision</strong></dt>
                <dd>In IBD detection evaluation, the proportion of detected segments that are truly IBD.</dd>
