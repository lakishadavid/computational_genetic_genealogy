            <h2>Lab 11: Statistical Distributions in Genetic Sharing</h2>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Statistical distributions are the mathematical language that connects genetics to genealogy. They allow us to convert biological patterns of DNA sharing into meaningful statements about relationships, making them the bridge between computational techniques and anthropological questions about kinship, identity, and human connections.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
            
            <h4>The Mathematics of Relationship</h4>
            <p>Human relationships follow mathematical patterns in our DNA. When we share common ancestors with someone, identifiable segments of our genome are "identical by descent" (IBD), meaning they come from the same ancestral chromosome. The distribution of these segments—their number, length, and pattern—follows predictable statistical laws that form the foundation of genetic genealogy.</p>
            
            <p>Each relationship has a genetic signature described by three key features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Total Amount of DNA Shared</strong> - The sum of all IBD segments, typically measured in centimorgans (cM)</li>
                <li><strong>Number of IBD Segments</strong> - How many distinct pieces of shared DNA exist</li>
                <li><strong>Length Distribution of Segments</strong> - The pattern of segment sizes, from long to short</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These features follow specific probability distributions that change in predictable ways as relationships become more distant:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Poisson distribution</strong> models the number of IBD segments shared between relatives</li>
                <li>The <strong>Exponential distribution</strong> describes the length of individual IBD segments</li>
                <li>The <strong>Gamma distribution</strong> characterizes the total amount of shared DNA</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Relationship Between Meiotic Distance and Genetic Sharing</h4>
            <p>Meiotic distance—the total number of meiosis events (cell divisions that create eggs or sperm) separating two individuals through their common ancestor—is the fundamental determinant of genetic relatedness. As genetic information passes through each generation, it undergoes recombination, where chromosomes exchange genetic material. This process fragments IBD segments in a mathematically predictable way:</p>
            
            <p>For simple relationships, the expected proportion of the genome shared is 2<sup>-d</sup>, where d is the meiotic distance. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parent-child (d=1): 50% shared DNA</li>
                <li>Full siblings (d=2): 25% shared DNA</li>
                <li>First cousins (d=4): 6.25% shared DNA</li>
                <li>Second cousins (d=6): 1.56% shared DNA</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>However, this simple formula only tells part of the story. As meiotic distance increases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <em>number</em> of shared segments initially increases (peaking around 10-12 meioses)</li>
                <li>The <em>length</em> of segments consistently decreases</li>
                <li>The <em>variance</em> in sharing increases dramatically</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This creates a distinctive pattern where closer relatives share fewer, longer segments, while more distant relatives share more numerous, shorter segments—until the segments become too short to detect.</p>

            <h3>Theoretical Foundations</h3>
            
            <h4>The ERSA Model</h4>
            <p>The ERSA (Estimated Relationship by Shared Ancestry) model provides a mathematical framework for understanding how IBD segments are distributed. The key equation predicts the expected number of shared segments (λ) based on:</p>
            
            <p><em>λ = [(num_ancestors × (num_recombinations × d + num_chromosomes)) / (2<sup>d-1</sup>)] × Pr(segment ≥ min_length)</em></p>
            
            <p>This equation captures several crucial insights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each recombination event creates a potential IBD segment boundary</li>
                <li>The probability of sharing decreases exponentially with meiotic distance</li>
                <li>Segment lengths follow an exponential distribution with parameter d/100 (in cM<sup>-1</sup>)</li>
                <li>Detection thresholds (minimum segment length) create bias in observed sharing</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This theoretical foundation allows us to predict the expected IBD sharing pattern for any relationship, providing a bridge between biological reality and genealogical interpretation.</p>

            <h4>Segment Length Distribution</h4>
            <p>The length of IBD segments follows an exponential distribution, reflecting the random nature of recombination events. For a relationship with meiotic distance d, the rate parameter is d/100 (in cM<sup>-1</sup>), meaning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The average segment length is 100/d centimorgans</li>
                <li>The probability of a segment exceeding length L is e<sup>-L×d/100</sup></li>
                <li>Shorter segments are always more common than longer ones</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This distribution explains why detection thresholds matter so much in genetic genealogy. When we can only reliably detect segments above a certain length (typically 3-7 cM), we systematically miss an increasing fraction of the actual shared segments as relationships become more distant.</p>

            <h3>Applications and Implications</h3>
            
            <h4>Relationship Inference</h4>
            <p>Statistical distributions enable algorithms to convert observed IBD patterns into relationship estimates. Different approaches like ERSA and Bonsai use the same underlying mathematics with slight variations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ERSA</strong> uses a maximum likelihood approach, finding the relationship that makes the observed number of segments most probable under a Poisson model</li>
                <li><strong>Bonsai</strong> refines this by accounting for segment overlap and incorporating more sophisticated models of recombination</li>
                <li>Both convert biological signals (IBD segments) into genealogical inferences (relationship estimates)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These algorithms can distinguish between relationships with the same total amount of shared DNA but different IBD patterns—for example, half-siblings versus grandparent-grandchild versus uncle-nephew—by analyzing the statistical distribution of segments.</p>

            <h4>Challenges and Limitations</h4>
            <p>Understanding the statistical foundations also reveals inherent limitations in genetic relationship inference:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inherent Randomness</strong>: The random nature of recombination creates substantial variance in sharing, especially for distant relationships</li>
                <li><strong>Detection Thresholds</strong>: Minimum segment length requirements systematically bias observations toward underestimating relationship distances</li>
                <li><strong>Endogamy and Population Structure</strong>: Non-random mating patterns violate model assumptions and distort expected distributions</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithm Differences</strong>: Different computational approaches can yield different relationship estimates from the same data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These limitations explain why genetic relationship estimates come with confidence intervals and sometimes can only narrow down possibilities rather than provide a definitive answer.</p>

            <h3>Broader Context</h3>
            
            <h4>Anthropological Significance</h4>
            <p>Statistical distributions of genetic sharing have profound implications for anthropological research:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kinship System Reconstruction</strong>: Observed patterns of IBD sharing within communities can reveal marriage customs, family structures, and social organization</li>
                <li><strong>Population History Detection</strong>: Deviations from expected distributions can signal historical events like bottlenecks, founder effects, or endogamy</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural-Biological Interactions</strong>: Statistical models can quantify how cultural practices (like cousin marriage) impact genetic structure</li>
                <li><strong>Indigenous Knowledge Integration</strong>: These models provide a framework for comparing oral genealogical traditions with genetic evidence</li>
                <li><strong>Diverse Kinship Recognition</strong>: Statistical approaches can be adapted to understand relationships in societies with non-Western family structures</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>By understanding these statistical patterns, anthropologists can move beyond simply detecting genetic relationships to interpreting them within their cultural and historical contexts.</p>

            <h4>Evolutionary Insights</h4>
            <p>The mathematics of IBD sharing connects not just to recent genealogy but to deeper questions of human evolution:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The same statistical principles apply to more ancient sharing, helping map historical population splits</li>
                <li>The distribution of very short IBD segments (below typical detection thresholds) contains information about ancient population history</li>
                <li>Statistical models connect genetic genealogy to population genetics and demographic inference</li>
                <li>The mathematics of recombination links our understanding of family relationships to evolutionary processes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These connections illustrate how the same mathematical principles apply across different time scales, from recent family history to deep human evolution.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>The statistical foundations of genetic relationship inference raise important ethical questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result Interpretation</strong>: How should uncertainty in statistical estimates be communicated to non-specialists?</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Implications</strong>: Statistical distributions make it possible to infer information about non-tested relatives</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Sensitivity</strong>: Do Western-derived statistical models adequately represent diverse cultural understandings of kinship?</li>
                <li><strong>Unexpected Findings</strong>: Statistical approaches can reveal misattributed parentage or other sensitive relationship information</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Understanding these issues requires not just mathematical literacy but also anthropological and ethical sensitivity.</p>

                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When working with these statistical models, remember that they represent idealized patterns. Real-world genetic sharing often deviates from theoretical expectations due to the inherent randomness of inheritance, population history, and technical limitations in IBD detection. Learning to interpret these deviations is as important as understanding the models themselves.</p>

            <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
            <p>As you explore statistical distributions in genetic relatedness, consider these broader implications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Probabilistic Nature:</strong> Genetic inheritance is inherently random, meaning relationship inference is always probabilistic</li>
                <li><strong>Uncertainty Communication:</strong> How can statistical uncertainty be effectively communicated to those seeking ancestral connections?</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Context:</strong> Statistical models reflect biological relationships, but human kinship systems incorporate social and cultural dimensions</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Implications:</strong> Statistical inference enables predictions about non-tested individuals, raising privacy considerations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These considerations connect the mathematical foundations of genetic relationships to real-world applications in genealogy, highlighting the importance of contextualizing statistical insights within broader anthropological and ethical frameworks.</p>
