    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with this notebook, ensure you have completed the **initial setup steps outlined in the `README.md` file** under the \"Ubuntu 24.04 Local Setup\" section. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  ✅ Cloning the `computational_genetic_genealogy` repository (referred to as `PROJECT_BASE_DIR`).\n",
    "2.  ✅ Manually creating the subdirectories (`data`, `results`, `references`, `utils`) within `PROJECT_BASE_DIR`.\n",
    "3.  ✅ Manually creating the `~/.env` file (in your home directory) with the correct absolute paths pointing to `PROJECT_BASE_DIR` and its subdirectories.\n",
    "4.  ✅ Installing all required system packages via `sudo apt install ...` (including Java 21, Python 3.12, build tools, R, TeX, etc.).\n",
    "5.  ✅ **Building and installing HTSlib, Samtools, and BCFtools version 1.18 from source** using the commands provided in the README.\n",
    "6.  ✅ Installing `poetry` via `pipx` and ensuring `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH.\n",
    "7.  ✅ Running `poetry install --no-root` within the `PROJECT_BASE_DIR` directory to install Python dependencies into `./.venv`.\n",
    "8.  ✅ Manually adding the `${PROJECT_BASE_DIR}/utils` directory to your `~/.bashrc` PATH and sourcing the file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`).\n",
    "9.  ✅ Configuring the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in `~/.bashrc`.\n",
    "10. ✅ Installing JAR files (Beagle, HapIBD, RefinedIBD), LiftOver, BonsaiTree, IBIS, Ped-Sim, RFMix2, and PLINK2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** This notebook assumes the `.env` file is located in your **home directory (`~/.env`)**, aligning with the Docker environment setup, and therefore **does not run** the `scripts_env/directory_setup.py` script."
